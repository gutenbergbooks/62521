call attention to some of the many questions
which are raised by an enquiry into the relative
antiquity of existing plants, and to illustrate the
nature of the evidence afforded by the records of

is but one art&mdash;to omit,' but to practise this art is
often a difficult task. While fully conscious of the
incompleteness of the treatment of the subjects dealt

<p class="caption3">INTRODUCTORY: THE LONGEVITY OF TREES, ETC.</p>



<p class="smaller">'Believe me who have tried. Thou wilt find something more in
woods than in books. Trees and rocks will teach what thou canst
not hear from a master.'&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="smcap">St Bernard.</span></p>


<p>The recent publication in the daily press of
instances of human longevity under the heading
'Links with the Past' prompted a comparison between
the length of time represented by the duration of a
tree and the lifetime of a human being. The comparison
of single lives suggested the further step of
contrasting the antiquity of the oldest family-histories
with the remoteness of the period to which it is
possible to trace the ancestry of existing members of
the plant kingdom.</p>

<p>My primary object in these pages is not to deal with
familiar cases of longevity in trees, but to consider
in the first place some of the problems connected with
the origin of the present British flora, and then to
describe a few examples of different types of plants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">« 2 »</a></span>
whose ancestors flourished during periods of the
earth's history long ages before the advent of the
human race.</p>

<p>In dealing with plants of former ages we are
confronted with the difficulty of forming an adequate
conception of the length of time embraced by geological
periods in comparison with the duration of
the historic era. Some of the 'Selections from the
Greek Papyri' recently edited by Dr Milligan
(Cambridge 1910) refer to common-place events in
terms familiar to us in modern letters: we forget
the interval of 2000 years which has elapsed since
they were written. Similarly, the close agreement
between existing plants and species which lived in
remote epochs speaks of continuity through the ages,
and bridges across an extent of time too great to
be expressed by ordinary standards of measurement.
Terms of years when extended beyond the limits
to which our minds are accustomed cease to have
any definite meaning. While there is a certain
academic interest in discussions as to the age
of the earth as expressed in years, we are utterly
unable to realise the significance of the chronology
employed. After speaking of the futility of attempting
to introduce chronological precision into periods so
recent as those which come into the purview of
archaeologists, Mr Rice Holmes suggests a method
better adapted to our powers. He says&mdash;'Ascend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">« 3 »</a></span>
the hill on which stands Dover Castle, and gaze
upon Cape Grisnez, let the waters beneath you
disappear; across the chalk that once spanned the
channel like a bridge men walked from the white
cliff that marks the horizon to where you stand.
No arithmetical chronology can spur the imagination
to flights like these(<a href="#Note_1">1</a>).' On the other hand, the
use in some country districts in Britain of spindles
almost identical with instruments used in spinning
by the ancient Egyptians, and similar survivals
described by the author of a book entitled <i>The
Past in the Present</i>(<a href="#Note_2">2</a>), bring within the range
of our vision an early phase of the historic era.
The rude implements still fashioned by the flint-knappers
of Brandon in Suffolk connect the present
with the Palaeolithic age. Measured from the
standpoint of historic reckoning, survivals from
prehistoric days appeal to us as persistent types
which have remained unchanged in a constantly
changing world.</p>

<p>In one of his essays Weismann quotes an old
German saying with regard to comparative longevity,
which asserts that 'a wren lives three years, a dog
three times as long as a wren' and so on in a regularly
ascending series: the life of a deer is estimated
at three times that of a crow and an oak three times
that of a deer, which means that, computed on this
basis, an oak lives nearly 20,000 years(<a href="#Note_3">3</a>)! This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
fanciful illustration of the relative longevity of an
oak is the expression of a truth, namely the superiority
of trees over animals in regard to the duration of
life. As a seventeenth-century translator of Pliny's
<i>Natural History</i> writes, 'In old times trees were the
very temples of the gods: and according to that
antient manner, the plaine and simple peasants of
the country, savouring still of antiquity, do at this
day consecrate to one God or other, the goodliest
and fairest trees that they can meet withal.' Oaks
growing in Pliny's day in the Hercynian forest are
said to have been there 'ever since the creation of
the world(<a href="#Note_4">4</a>).' Sir Joseph Hooker, in an account
of some Palestine oaks, gives a drawing of a famous
tree at Mamre, known as Abraham's Oak, which is
supposed to mark the spot where the Patriarch
pitched his tent(<a href="#Note_5">5</a>). Examples such as these,
though of no scientific value, serve to illustrate the
well-founded belief in the extraordinary longevity of
trees. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it
would be rash to deny the possibility that William
the Conqueror's Oak in Windsor Forest, described
by Loudon in his <i>Arboretum Britannicum</i> and
mentioned by later writers, may be a survival from
the reign of the king whose name it bears. Although
it is seldom possible to state with confidence the
exact age of old oaks and yews famed for length of
days, there can be no doubt as to the enormous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">« 5 »</a></span>
antiquity of many of our trees whose years are
'sacred with many a mystery.' The section of a
trunk of one of the mammoth trees of California
(<i>Sequoia gigantea</i>) exhibited in the Natural History
department of the British Museum, shows on its
polished surface 1335 concentric rings denoting
successive increments of wood produced by the
activity of a cylinder of cells situated between the
hard woody tissue and the bark. It is generally
assumed that each year a tree produces a single
ring, though, as is well known, an estimate of age
calculated on this assumption cannot be regarded as
more than an approximation to the truth. If this
giant tree, which was felled in 1890, was then 1335
years old, it had already reached an age of over two
centuries when Charlemagne was crowned Emperor
at Rome. The concentric rings on a tree trunk owe
their existence to certain structural differences between
the wood formed in the spring and in the late
summer. In Sequoia, as in other members of the
great class of cone-bearing trees, the wood is composed
of comparatively narrow elements which serve
to carry water from the roots to the branches and
leaves. As spring succeeds winter the inactivity
of the plant-machine is followed by a period of
energetic life; opening buds and elongating shoots
create a demand for a plentiful supply of ascending
sap, and in response to this the tree produces a fresh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span>
cylinder of wood composed of relatively wide conducting
tubes. After the first rush of life is succeeded
by a phase of more uniform and gentler activity, the
demand for water becomes less exacting and the
wood which is formed during the rest of the growing
season consists of narrower water-pipes. A period of
rest ensues, until in the following spring new layers
of larger tubes are laid down in juxtaposition to the
narrower elements of the latest phase of the preceding
summer. This alternation of larger and smaller
tubes produces the appearance of concentric rings on
a cross-section of a tree. It is not the pause in the
active life of the plant which is responsible for the
effect of rings, but the fact that the wood produced
immediately before and immediately after the pause
is not structurally identical. In trees grown under
the more uniform conditions of certain tropical
regions, the annual rings are either feebly developed or
absent; for example, in some Indian oaks the wood
shows no concentric rings of growth.</p>

<p>Stated in general terms, rings of growth in the
wood of a tree are the expression of a power possessed
by the plant of regulating the structure of its component
elements in response to the varying nature of
the external stimuli. In certain circumstances, for
example after the destruction of the young buds by
caterpillars, the tree makes a special effort to repair
the loss by producing a new set of shoots. This may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">« 7 »</a></span>
be recorded by the occurrence of two concentric rings
in one season. An extreme instance of departure
from the normal has recently been described(<a href="#Note_6">6</a>) in
which a tree of <i>Theobroma cacao</i> (the cocoa tree),
planted in Ceylon in the summer of 1893 and felled
in January 1901, after a life of just over 7 years, was
found to have 22 rings in its stem. In this case the
tree shed its leaves three times a year, and each break
in the uniformity of its vital activities was registered
by the apposition of what under ordinary conditions
are spoken of as spring and late-summer wood.
At Aden trees stated by natives to be very old
showed only five or six rings of wood, a fact connected
with the almost complete lack of rain and with the
uniform conditions of existence.</p>

<p>The degree of accuracy to be allowed to estimates
of age founded on the number of 'annual' rings is,
however, of secondary importance in comparison
with the enormously greater hold on life possessed
by trees as contrasted with the higher animals. Early
in the nineteenth century the Swiss botanist A. P.
de Candolle expressed the opinion that trees do not
die from senile decay, but only as the result of injury
or disease. Trees are constructed on a plan fundamentally
different from that underlying the structure
of the highly complex human organism, and are thus
endowed with a sort of potential immortality. It has
been suggested that some of the large corals in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span>
Red Sea which are still tenanted by living polyps
may have been growing in the days of the Pharaohs.
The coral polyp represents the growing portion of a
lifeless mass of rock which is constantly extended by
the activity of the organism at the summit of each
branch. Between a coral-reef and a tree there are
many essential differences, but a rough analogy may
be recognised. A tree, unlike the higher animals,
does not reach a stage at which the whole of its
substance attains a condition of permanence and
fixity. It consists of a complex branching-system
in which each shoot increases in length by virtue
of the youthful vigour of its apex: to a large extent
the tree as a whole consists of lifeless material incapable
of further growth, as is the case of the older
portions of a coral-reef; but the regular increase in
girth of the trunk and its branches demonstrates that
this comparison is only partially true, and that the
power of growth in a tree is not confined to the
extremities of the youngest shoots. The tip of every
twig is composed of minute cells endowed with a
potentiality of development like that which characterises
the embryonic tissues of a seedling just
emerged from the seed. In the course of its growth,
each branch, by means of its living and dividing
cells, contributes to the several parts of the complex
mechanism of the tree. While the greater number
of cells acquire a permanent form and lose the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">« 9 »</a></span>
power of further development, there remains a cylinder
of cells endowed with perpetual youth. This
cylinder of living cells, known as the cambium, extends
between the wood and bark from one end of the tree
to the other: by its periodic activity it adds new layers
of tissue each year and thus, by increasing the amount
of conducting tubes for the transport of water and
for the distribution of elaborated food, it enables the
tree to respond to the increasing demands which
are the necessary accompaniment of increasing size.
It has already been pointed out that in the spring
when the sap flows most vigorously the cambial
cylinder produces larger tubes, and afterwards when
the tree settles down to its normal life, these are
succeeded by narrower and stronger tubes. These
later formed elements serve also an important mechanical
purpose; by the strength of their walls they
increase the supporting power of the tree and enable
it to sustain the added burden of the annual increase
in the weight and extent of its spreading branches.</p>

<p>It is the persistence of permanently juvenile tissue
in certain regions of a tree, together with the remarkable
power of repairing injuries and shedding
effete parts, that constitute some of the most striking
contrasts between the higher animals and plants.
The embryo oak in the earlier stages of development
consists entirely of actively growing cells; by degrees
differentiation of the embryonic tissues results in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span>
localisation of regions of cell-production at the tips
of the elongating stem and root. These apical groups
of cells are, in fact, portions of the embryonic organism
which persist so long as the plant lives. This continuity
between the growing tip of an old oak stem
and the cells of the undifferentiated embryo affords
one of the most remarkable examples in nature of
a link between the past and the present.</p>

<p>If we pass beyond the stretch of time represented
by the life of a single tree, a few successive generations
suffice to carry our retrospect back to the days
when forests of oaks, birches, and other trees impeded
the progress of the Roman invaders, and, a
stage farther back, to the age of Neolithic man whose
remains are occasionally found in our heaths and
moors and in the submerged forests round our coast.
The blocks of oak and beech, some of which are as
sound as when first felled, recently discovered below
the foundations of parts of Winchester Cathedral constructed
at the end of the twelfth or in the opening
years of the thirteenth century, are relics of Norman
forests. In the course of some excavations at Brigg in
Lincolnshire in 1886 a dug-out boat was found nearly
50 feet long and from 4 to 5 feet in breadth. The stem
of the oak from which the canoe had been fashioned
shows no sign of branching for a length of over 40
feet, a fact which points to the growth of the tree
in a forest where the race for light induced the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span>
development of clean columnar stems. The Brigg
'dug-out,' now in the Hull Museum, was discovered in
an old alluvial valley of the Ancholme river, formerly
connected with the Humber, and it may be that
it was used by Neolithic man as a ferry for river-service(<a href="#Note_7">7</a>).</p>

<p>From the period claimed by archaeologists we
pass by gradual stages into the domain of the
geologist. As Huxley wrote, 'when even the dim
light of Archaeology fades, there yet remains Palaeontology,
which... has brought to daylight once more
the exuvia of ancient populations, whose world was
not our world, who have been buried in river beds
immemorially dry, or carried by the rush of waters
into caves, inaccessible to inundation since the dawn
of tradition(<a href="#Note_8">8</a>).' The length of time represented by
a succession of long-lived individuals of the same
species becomes enormously extended when we pass
to the history of families, and disinter from the
sediments of other ages the remains of extinct types.
As we descend the geological series familiar types
gradually disappear, and through a succession of
changing floras we penetrate to the fragmentary
records contained in the older rocks until the absence
of documents sets a limit to our quest.</p>

<p>The Scots pine shares with the oak, the beech,
the aspen, the yew, and several other trees the right
to be included in the native flora of Britain. In the
peat-beds of Scotland even up to 3000 feet above
sea-level the stumps of pines occur in abundance,
and in many places recent researches have revealed
the occurrence of successive forests of pines, oaks,
and spruces separated from one another by the
accumulations of swampy vegetation(<a href="#Note_9">9</a>). The spruce
fir has long ceased to be a member of the British
flora, but in a few localities in the Scottish Highlands
patches of primeval pine forests remain. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">« 13 »</a></span>
accompanying photograph (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>), taken by my friend
Mr A. G. Tansley, in the Black Wood of Rannoch in
north-west Perthshire, shows a few trees of <i>Pinus
sylvestris</i> growing in their native soil: the form of
the older tree (<i>A</i>) suggests comparison with that of
a well-grown beech such as we are familiar with
in English plantations. This spreading dome-shaped
habit seems to be a peculiarity of the Highland tree,
and is one of the characters which have led some
botanists to regard it as a variety (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>
var. <i>scotica</i>) of the ordinary Scots pine. Though it
is doubtful if any relics of primeval pine woods are
left in England, abundant evidence of the former
existence of the Scots pine is afforded by the submerged
forests exposed at low-tide on many parts of
the English and Welsh coasts and at the base of
some of the English peat moors. During the construction
of the Barry docks on the north coast of
the Bristol Channel a few years ago, the exposed
sections of peat and forest beds were investigated by
Dr Strahan and by Mr Clement Reid. There is
evidence of a subsidence of the land to an extent of
55 feet since the formation of the lower peat-beds
containing oak, hazel, willow, and other trees. The
pine, unknown in Wales during the historic period,
was recognised in the Barry cutting. The occurrence
of a polished flint implement assigns a date to the
uppermost portion of this old land-surface(<a href="#Note_10">10</a>).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span></p>
<p>It is impossible within the limits of a small volume
to discuss in detail the evidence furnished by the
records of the rocks as to the relative antiquity of
the different constituents of the present vegetation
of Britain. In later chapters a few selected plants
are described which are pre-eminently ancient types.
Before passing to the consideration of the data on
which the geological history of plants is based, brief
reference may be made to one of the most interesting
and difficult problems of botanical research, namely
the history of the British flora.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF PLANTS</p>

<p class="smaller">'No speculation is idle or fruitless that is not opposed to truth
or to probability, and which, whilst it co-ordinates a body of well
established facts, does so without violence to nature, and with a due
regard to the possible results of future discoveries.'&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="smcap">Sir Joseph Hooker.</span></p>


<p>In the vegetation of the British Isles the leading
<i>rôle</i> is played by that large group to which the term
Flowering Plants is frequently applied. This group,
including the two sub-divisions Dicotyledons and
Monocotyledons, is known by the name Angiosperms,
a designation denoting the important fact that the
seeds are developed in an ovary or protective seed-case
(&#7937;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#959;&#957;, a vessel or box). The fact that these
highly elaborated products of development made
their appearance, so far as we know, at a comparatively
late stage in the history of the plant-world,
attests their efficiency as a class and demonstrates
the rapidity with which they have overspread the
surface of the earth as successful competitors in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span>
the struggle for existence. As Darwin wrote in a
letter to Sir Joseph Hooker in 1881, 'Nothing is
more extraordinary in the history of the vegetable
kingdom, as it seems to me, than the <i>apparently</i>
very sudden or abrupt development of the higher
plants(<a href="#Note_11">11</a>).' In another letter (1879) to the same friend
we read, 'The rapid development as far as we can
judge of all the higher plants within recent geological
times is an abominable mystery(<a href="#Note_12">12</a>).' Making allowance
for the probability, or indeed certainty, that
the imperfection of the geological record tends to
exaggerate the apparent suddenness of the appearance
of this vigorous class, and allowing for
the fact that our knowledge of the records of
the rocks in which the highest plants first occur
is very incomplete, we cannot escape from the
conclusion that this recently evolved group spread
with amazing rapidity. Various reasons may be
suggested in explanation of the dominant position
which the Angiosperms hold in the floras of the
world. As an instance of their rapid increase during
the Cretaceous epoch<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, the period which has furnished
the earliest satisfactory records of Flowering Plants,
the following statement by an American writer may
be quoted:&mdash;'The rapidity with which it [<i>i.e.</i> the
group of Flowering Plants] advanced, conquering or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">« 17 »</a></span>
supplanting all rivals, may be better understood
when we remember that it forms 85% of the flora
of the Dakota group '; that is a series of sedimentary
rocks in Dakota referred by geologists to the middle
of the Cretaceous period(<a href="#Note_13">13</a>). In the Wealden rocks
of England, which are rich in the remains of Lower
Cretaceous plants, no undoubted Flowering Plant
has so far been found.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> For the position of the Cretaceous and other systems in the
geological series, see the table on <a href="#Page_42">page 42</a>.</p></div>

<p>The more efficient protection of the ovules, the
germs which, after fertilisation, become the seeds,
the extraordinary variety in the floral mechanisms
for assisting cross-pollination, the arrangements for
nursing the embryo, and the structural features of
the wood in relation both to rapid transport of water
and to the storage of food, are factors which have
probably contributed to the success of the Angiosperms.
The degree of weight to assign to each
contributing cause cannot as yet be satisfactorily
determined, but the general question raised by the
recent origin of these latest products of evolution
offers a promising field for work. While admitting
our inability at present to do more than suggest
possibilities, we may encourage research by speculation.</p>

<p>The members of the Vegetable Kingdom placed
next to the Flowering Plants are the Gymnosperms
or naked-seeded (&#947;&#965;&#956;&#957;&#8001;&#962;, naked) plants, including
(i) the Conifers, <i>e.g.</i> pines, firs, larches, the yew, etc.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span>
(ii) a small group of plants known as the Cycads,
whose existing members, now almost confined to
a few tropical regions, are the descendants of a
vigorous race represented by many species in the
floras of the Mesozoic epoch. A third sub-division
of the Gymnosperms, the Ginkgoales, is represented
by a single survivor, which is described in a later
chapter as one of the most remarkable links with the
past in the plant kingdom.</p>

<p>The Gymnosperms are geologically very much
older than the Angiosperms. Members of this class
played a prominent part in the vegetation of the
Coal age and it is certain that they existed in the
still older Devonian period. The only other group
to which reference is made in later chapters is that
of the Ferns, one of the sub-divisions of a large class
known as the Vascular Cryptogams or Pteridophyta.
These plants, like the Gymnosperms, are represented
in the oldest floras of which recognisable remains
have been preserved. The main groups of the
vegetable kingdom, founded on existing plants, are
distinguished by well-defined differences; they are
comparable with separate twigs of a tree springing
from larger branches and these again uniting below
in a common trunk. The vegetation of to-day represents
only the terminal portions of the upper
branches. As we descend the geological series,
records of extinct types are found which enable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span>
us either to trace the separate branches to a common
origin or to recognise a convergence towards a
common stock. Were a botanist to find himself in
a forest of the Coal age he would experience great
difficulty in assigning some of the plants to their
systematic position: characters now regarded as
distinguishing features of distinct groups would be
met with in combination in a single individual. It
is by the discovery of such generalised types, which
serve as finger-posts pointing the way to lines of
evolution, that the student of pre-existing plants has
been able to throw light on the relative antiquity of
existing forms, and to trace towards a common
ancestry plants which now show but little indication
of consanguinity.</p>

<p>Confining our attention to the dominant group of
plants in the British flora, namely the Flowering
Plants, we may profitably consider the question,
though we cannot satisfactorily answer it,&mdash;which
members of this group are entitled to be regarded
as the most ancient inhabitants? The past history
of our native plants, and their geographical range,
not only in the British Isles but on the Continent
of Europe, are subjects well worthy of the attention
of field-botanists whose interests are apt to be
confined within too narrow bounds. There are
numerous problems relating to the composition of
the present vegetation of Britain which might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">« 20 »</a></span>
discussed in reference to the relative antiquity of
plants; but in a single chapter it is impossible to do
more than call attention to certain considerations
which are frequently overlooked by students of
British species.</p>

<p>It is customary to speak of the British flora as
consisting for the most part of species introduced
into this country by natural means, while some
plants owe their introduction to human agency or
are 'escapes' from cultivation. It is by no means
an easy task in some instances to decide whether a
species is native or introduced, but in some cases,
a few of which are mentioned, there is no doubt as to
the alien nature of the plants. The term 'native'
needs a word of explanation. It is not intended to
convey the idea that a plant so designated came into
existence on British soil and spread thence to other
regions; but by native species we mean such as have
reached this country by migration from other lands,
or it may be in some instances have actually originated
in this part of Europe. One of the best known
aliens in Britain is the American water-weed, <i>Elodea
canadensis</i> (or <i>Anacharis alsinastrum</i>), which was
discovered about sixty years ago in a canal near
Market Harborough in Leicestershire(<a href="#Note_14">14</a>). In all probability
this North American species was introduced
into England with timber. Once established, it
spread through the waterways with alarming rapidity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span>
and became a serious pest. Elodea affords an admirable
instance of the serious interference with the
balance of Nature by the introduction of a new
competitor into an environment conducive to
vigorous development. Another foreign water-plant,
<i>Naias graminea</i>, for the importation of which
Egyptian cotton may be responsible, has been
recorded from the Reddish canal near Manchester(<a href="#Note_15">15</a>).
This African and Asiatic species occurs in Europe only
as a colonist; it is said to have been introduced into
Italy with East Indian rice. A more recent case of alien
immigration due to unintentional human agency is
that of <i>Potamogeton pennsylvanicus</i>, a pond-weed of
Canada, the United States, Jamaica, and elsewhere.
Specimens of this species were first noticed in 1907
in a canal near Halifax close to the effluent from
a cotton mill. Since its discovery the plant has
slightly extended its range. It is suggested by
Mr Bennett, who first identified the alien, that its
fruits were brought to this country in goods from
the United States(<a href="#Note_16">16</a>).</p>

<p>Of the introduction of these and other foreign
plants we have satisfactory records; but there are
many others which may owe their presence to man's
agency, though we have no information as to their
arrival.</p>

<p>It has long been recognised that several members
of the British flora are related to Scandinavian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span>
species. The Scandinavian flora, as Sir Joseph
Hooker says in his well-known paper on the 'Outlines
of the Distribution of Arctic plants,' 'not only
girdles the globe in the Arctic Circle, and dominates
over all others in the North Temperate Zone of the
Old World, but intrudes conspicuously into every
other temperate flora, whether in the northern or
southern hemisphere, or on the Alps of tropical
countries'(<a href="#Note_17">17</a>). The view generally held is that during
the Glacial period this Arctic flora was driven
South, and aided by land-bridges, which were afterwards
submerged, many of the northern migrants
found a more congenial home in Britain. It is however
by no means improbable that this conclusion
may have to be considerably modified. Mr and Mrs
Reid, as the result of their careful analysis of the
Pre-Glacial Flora of Britain, express the opinion that
'the pre-glacial plants suggest climatic conditions
almost identical with those now existing, though
slightly warmer' (27, 2). It is noteworthy that the
list of plants given in their paper does not include
any typical Arctic species. The occurrence on the
mountains of Scotland and elsewhere of such plants as
<i>Silene acaulis</i>, <i>Dryas octopetala</i>, <i>Saxifraga oppositifolia</i>
and other Saxifrages, <i>Rubus chamaemorus</i> (the
Cloudberry), and the dwarf Birch illustrate the Arctic-Alpine
element in our flora.</p>

<p>The opinion is held by many Swiss botanists that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">« 23 »</a></span>
their Alpine species have in large measure been
derived from non-glaciated parts of the Pyrenees, that
is from a region which was presumably able to retain
its flora at a time when more northern lands were
exposed to extreme Arctic conditions. My friend
Dr Moss believes that some of the so-called Scandinavian
plants came to Britain from Central Europe
after the retreat of the ice; if this view is correct it
means that some at least of our Arctic-Alpine plants
reached these islands by a southern rather than by
a northern route.</p>

<p>Interesting examples of far-travelled northern
plants recently described by Professor Engler of
Berlin afford additional illustrations of the general
principles enunciated many years ago by Sir Joseph
Hooker. A species of flowering Rush, <i>Luzula
spicata</i> var. <i>simensis</i>, occurs at an altitude of 3600
metres in Abyssinia and on Kilimanjaro. <i>Luzula
spicata</i> is found in the whole of the Arctic and
Subarctic belt in Scotland, Auvergne, the Jura
mountains, and elsewhere. The species probably
began its career in the northern hemisphere where
it grew abundantly on the higher ground in the
Arctic Circle: it eventually travelled along the
North American Andes and appeared in Mexico
under a guise sufficiently distinct to warrant the
use of another name, <i>Luzula racemosa</i>. In an
eastern direction it reached the Himalayas and is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">« 24 »</a></span>
represented in Abyssinia by a closely allied form.
From Abyssinia to Kilimanjaro <i>Luzula spicata</i> 'had
to travel a long distance; but it is not impossible
that it either still exists or has existed previously
on a few of the high mountains between Abyssinia
and Kenia, from which, having advanced to the
Kilimanjaro, it again produced new forms.... At any
rate, it is impossible to do without distribution of
seeds of alpine plants by air-currents or by birds
from one mountain to the other in explaining the
history of distribution'(<a href="#Note_18">18</a>).</p>

<p>The majority of British plants are identical with
species in Central and Northern Europe: of these,
some are among the most widely spread English
species, <i>e.g.</i> the Daisy and Primrose, while others,
such as the Oxlip (<i>Primula elatior</i>), are confined to
the Eastern counties, and others, such as the Cheddar
Pink (<i>Dianthus caesius</i>), are restricted to Western
counties.</p>

<p>Before considering a small section of the British
flora which is the most interesting from the point of
view of origin, a short digression may be allowed in
order to call attention to the importance of a branch
of science which Darwin spoke of as 'that grand
subject, that almost keystone of the laws of creation,
geographical distribution,' and in 1847 referred to
as 'that noble subject of which we as yet but dimly
see the full bearing.' It was largely as the results
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">« 25 »</a></span>
of his study of distribution in the Galapagos Islands
that Darwin determined to 'collect blindly every
sort of fact which bears anyway on what are species.'
The acceptance of the view 'that each species was
first produced within a single region'(<a href="#Note_19">19</a>), raises the
subject of geographical distribution to a far higher
plane than it occupied in pre-Darwinian days. Although
most people are familiar with some of the
commoner means by which plants are able to colonise
new ground through the adaptation of their fruits and
seeds to various methods of transport, the conception
of a plant as a stationary organism tends to prevent
due allowance being made for the comparative
facility with which, in the course of successive
generations, a species is able to wander from place
to place. The individual animal is endowed with
powers of locomotion enabling it to seek new feeding-grounds
and to avoid enemies; but with the
exception of some of the simplest forms a plant
cannot move&mdash;'le matin la laisse où la trouve le
soir.'</p>

<p>The rate of travel may or may not be rapid, but
in a comparatively short time, if the conditions are
favourable, a tree may spread over a wide area.
Mr Ridley, Director of the Botanic Gardens, Singapore,
writes as follows in reference to the rate of
travel of one of the common Malayan trees (<i>Shorea
leprosula</i>), which bears winged fruits particularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">« 26 »</a></span>
well adapted to wind-transport: 'If we assume that a
tree flowers and fruits at 30 years of age and the fruits
are disseminated to a distance of 100 yards, that the
furthest fruits always germinate and so continue in
one direction, it will be seen that under such most
favourable circumstances the species can only spread
800 yards in 100 years, and would take 58,666 years
to migrate 100 miles'(<a href="#Note_20">20</a>).</p>

<p>There is, however, one type of distribution&mdash;what
is called discontinuous distribution&mdash;to which
special attention should be directed on account of its
intimate association with questions relating to the
past history of living organisms. Many examples
might be quoted from both the animal and plant
kingdoms in support of the view that discontinuous
distribution is a criterion of antiquity. When identical
or very nearly identical plants occur in regions
separated from one another by areas in which the
particular species is unknown, the inference is either
that the surviving individuals are remnants of a large
number formerly distributed over a wider continuous
area, or that in the course of evolution similar conditions
in widely separated areas led to the production
of identical types. The former view is much the more
probable: it is consistent with the conclusions arrived
at on other grounds as to the connexion between
discontinuous distribution and ancient lineage. The
explanations of the widespread occurrence among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">« 27 »</a></span>
different races of similar objects or legends afford an
analogous case. As Dr Andrew Lang points out in
<i>Custom and Myth</i>, it is held by some students that
the use of the bull roarer&mdash;to cite a specific instance&mdash;by
different peoples denotes descent from a common
stock, though he considers the more probable explanation
to be that similar minds, working with
simple means towards similar ends, might evolve the
bull roarer and its mystic uses anywhere.</p>

<p>The Cedars of Lebanon afford an interesting example
of discontinuous distribution. They illustrate
how a species, which may be assumed to have
originated in one region, in the course of its
wanderings may undergo slight changes until, at
a later stage when the plants have disappeared from
parts of the once-continuous area, the remaining
outlying groups of individuals are spoken of under
different specific names. The cedars of Lebanon,
known as <i>Cedrus libani</i>, occur as isolated groups
on the Lebanon hills as outliers of the larger forests
of the Taunus 250 miles distant. The African cedar,
<i>Cedrus atlantica</i>, is separated from the Lebanon
cedar by a distance of 1400 miles. Approximately
the same distance divides the Lebanon cedar from
the deodar, <i>Cedrus deodara</i>, which extends from
Afghanistan along the Himalayas almost to the
confines of Nepal. Sir Joseph Hooker regards the
three cedars as varieties of one species which once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">« 28 »</a></span>
formed a continuous forest: he attributes the present
discontinuous distribution, in part at least, to the
effects of a warmer succeeding a colder climate. The
less favourable conditions drove the vegetation of
the lowlands to seek more congenial habitats at
higher altitudes. In this connexion it is interesting
to find that in Algeria the cedar is confined to the
higher ground where the snow lies long in the
spring(<a href="#Note_21">21</a>).</p>

<p>The Tulip Tree of North America and Central
China affords one of many examples of existing
flowering plants which illustrate the close connexion
between present distribution and past history. The
genus Liriodendron, often cultivated in the south
of England, is now represented by two species, the
best known of which&mdash;the Tulip Tree, <i>Liriodendron
tulipera</i>&mdash;extends from Vermont to Florida and
westwards to Lake Michigan and Arkansas. The
leaves bear a superficial resemblance to those of
the Sycamore, but are as a rule easily distinguished
by the truncated form of the apex; the specific name
was suggested by the tulip-like form of the flowers.
Fossil leaves of Liriodendron are not uncommon in
the Cretaceous rocks of Disco Island in latitude 70&deg; N.,
where they occur with other flowering plants which
bear striking testimony to the mildness of the Cretaceous
climate in high northern latitudes. One
of the associated flowering plants is a species of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">« 29 »</a></span>
Artocarpus, described by Dr Nathorst as <i>Artocarpus
Dicksoni</i> which bears a close resemblance to <i>A. incisa</i>
the bread-fruit tree of the southern tropics of the
Old World. Without attempting to deal fully with
the past history of Liriodendron, it may be confidently
stated that the records of the rocks are consistent
with the idea of antiquity suggested by the present
distribution of the two surviving species.</p>

<p>Islands such as Great Britain and Ireland, situated
a short distance from a continent, contain many plants
which are widely spread in different parts of the
world, together with a very small number peculiar
to the British Isles though closely allied to species
on the neighbouring continent or to plants farther
afield. The occasional recognition of species previously
believed to be confined to Britain tends to
reduce the short list of our endemic types.</p>

<p>An enquiry into the origin of an island flora
involves a consideration of the data in regard to
changes in level and relative distribution of land
and water in the course of geological evolution. It
is generally agreed that at no distant date, in a
geological sense. Great Britain and Ireland were
united to the continent. There is, however, another
fact to reckon with, namely the prevalence of Arctic
conditions in northern Europe when a thick sheet of
ice spread over the greater part of the British Isles.
There can be no doubt that the severity of the climate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">« 30 »</a></span>
during the Glacial period was such as to destroy
a large proportion of the vegetation. The question
is, were all the flowering plants destroyed or were
some of the hardier species able to survive, either on
the higher peaks which kept their heads above the
level of the ice or on the southern fringe of England
beyond the ice-covered region? It is impossible to
give a definite answer: the probability is that nearly
all the pre-Glacial species were destroyed, but it is
not impossible that some Alpine-Arctic plants escaped
extinction, while others retreated to more southern
and less Arctic areas by means of a land-connexion
with France or crossed the intervening sea by ocean-currents,
by animal agency, or by wind.</p>

<p>Although we possess but imperfect information as
to the extent and duration of land-bridges between
Britain and the continent, there are no special
difficulties in the way of accounting for the presence
of Scandinavian, Germanic, and other elements in the
British flora. There are, however, other and more
difficult problems to consider in reference to a small
group of flowering plants which are met with in the
west and south of Ireland, also, to a less extent, in
Cornwall and in a few other localities in the south-west
of England. In Connemara in the west of Ireland,
where hard frosts are unknown and winter snows are
rare, there are three kinds of Heath, St Dabeoc's Heath
(<i>Daboecia polifolia</i>), the Mediterranean Heath (<i>Erica
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">« 31 »</a></span>
mediterranea</i>) and <i>Erica Mackaii</i> which are not
found elsewhere in the British Isles or in the whole
of northern Europe, but reappear in the Pyrenees.
The London Pride (<i>Saxifraga umbrosa</i>), another
Pyrenean plant, grows on the south and west coast
of Ireland from Waterford to Donegal. <i>Arbutus
Unedo</i>, the Strawberry tree, which flourishes in the
Killarney district of County Kerry and occurs in
neighbouring localities, has a wide distribution in
the Mediterranean region. Devonshire and Cornwall
possess two other Heaths, <i>Erica ciliaris</i>, which extends
into Dorsetshire and occurs in north Brittany,
and <i>Erica vagans</i>, both Pyrenean species, while a
Mediterranean plant. <i>Gladiolus illyricus</i>, grows in the
New Forest.</p>

<p>In 1846 Edward Forbes dealt with the problems
presented by the distribution of British plants in an
essay which has exercised a far-reaching influence.
When Forbes published his work, comparatively little
was known as to the possibilities of transport of seeds
and fruits across barriers of water(<a href="#Note_22">22</a>). His conviction
that the known means of dispersal were insufficient
to account for the presence of Mediterranean or
Lusitanian plants in Ireland led him to turn to
geology for a solution of the problem. He was thus
led to put forward the view that in the course of
the Tertiary period when, as we know from palaeontological
evidence, the climate of north and west
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">« 32 »</a></span>
Europe was much warmer than it is now, and long-before
the beginning of the climatic changes which
culminated in the Glacial period, there was a land-connexion
between the west of Ireland and the
south-west of the continent. Mr Praeger, whose
work on the Irish flora is well known to systematic
botanists, agrees with the conclusions of Forbes, and
sees in the Portuguese and Mediterranean plants
'relics of a vegetation which once spread along a
bygone European coast-line which stretched unbroken
from Ireland to Spain'(<a href="#Note_23">23</a>). If this explanation is
correct it entitles Arbutus, St Dabeoc's heath and
other members of this southern group to be regarded
as a very old section of our flora. There is, however,
another side to the question: granting that a certain
number of Irish plants were able to withstand the
rigours of an Ice age, it is hardly likely that the
strawberry tree and other southern types, which it
is admitted flourish in the south-west of Ireland
because of the mildness of the climate, were of the
number of those which endured an extreme Arctic
phase. Moreover, if these Mediterranean species are
survivals from the Tertiary period, if they have been
isolated since pre-Glacial days as an outlier of a
southern flora, we might fairly expect that during
the long interval between their arrival and the
present day new forms would have been produced
closely related to, though not identical with, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">« 33 »</a></span>
parent types. This, however, has not been proved to
be the case. Darwin in speaking of Forbes' Essay in
a letter to de Candolle in 1863 says that he differs
from most of his contemporaries 'in thinking that
the vast continental extensions of Forbes, Heer, and
others are not only advanced without sufficient evidence,
but are opposed to much weighty evidence'(<a href="#Note_12">12</a>).
The alternative view is to regard Arbutus and its
compatriots as post-Glacial arrivals and not as survivals
from a widely spread Tertiary flora.</p>

<p>A recently published account of the New Flora
of the volcanic island of Krakatau furnishes an
instructive and remarkable demonstration of the
facility with which a completely sterilised island,
separated by several miles of ocean from neighbouring
lands, may be restocked with vegetation(<a href="#Note_24">24</a>).
In 1883 the island of Krakatau, then densely covered
with a luxuriant tropical vegetation, was partially
destroyed by a series of exceptionally violent volcanic
explosions. After this catastrophe only a third of
the island was left: the surface was deeply covered
by pumice and volcanic ash and no vestige of life
remained. In 1906 a party of botanists who spent
a few hours on Krakatau collected 137 species of
plants: the vegetation was in places so dense that
it was with the greatest difficulty they penetrated
beyond the coastal belt, and some of the trees had
reached a height of 50 feet. The seeds and fruits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">« 34 »</a></span>
of this new flora have been carried by ocean-currents,
by wind, and by the agency of birds from other
islands in the Malay Archipelago. The nearest
islands, except the small island of Sebesi, about
12 miles distant, are Java and Sumatra, separated
from Krakatau by a stretch of water about 25 miles
in breadth. It is reasonable to wonder whether, had
Forbes known of this and similar modern instances
of the capabilities of plants as travellers, he would
have adopted the view he did. In this connexion it
may be added that in recent years the glaciation of
Ireland has been shown to be more extensive than it
was believed to be when Forbes wrote his essay.</p>

<p>There would seem to be no insuperable objection
to the conclusion that the Mediterranean plants in
Ireland and in the south of England reached their
present home after the retreat of the ice at the
end of the Glacial period, and after Ireland became
an island. A full consideration of the problem is
beyond the scope of this book, but I have briefly
stated the case, not with the authority of an expert
but in order to draw attention to a particularly
fascinating study in plant-migration.</p>

<p>In a volume by W. Canton entitled <i>A Child's
book of Saints</i> a story is told in which the presence
in Ireland of Mediterranean species receives a more
picturesque explanation. The Monk Bresal was sent
to teach the brethren in a Spanish monastery the
music of Irish choirs. In later years Bresal longed
for a sight of his native land, though he loved his
home and 'every rock, tree, and flower' in his adopted
country. After returning to Ireland, his thoughts
reverted to Spain; 'it appeared to him as though
he was once again in a granite nook among the rocks
beside the Priory'; he saw the ice-plant with its
little stars of white flowers sprinkled with red (the
London Pride) and a small evergreen tree from which
he had often gathered the orange-scarlet berries
(Arbutus). The Prior of the Spanish monastery 'with
heavenly vision saw Bresal gazing at the evergreen
tree and the ice-plant, and turning to the trees
blessed them and commended them to go and make
real his dream. As Bresal brushed away his tears
he saw with amazement at his feet the ice-plant and
hard by the evergreen tree.'</p>

<p>The plant represented in (<a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>) is another
British species which tasks the ingenuity of students
of plant-geography. This is the Pipe Wort (<i>Eriocaulon
septangulare</i>), the sole representative in
Europe of a certain family of Monocotyledons: it
flourishes in the west of Ireland and in the western
islands of Scotland but nowhere else in Europe; it is
native on the other side of the Atlantic in Canada
and the northern United States of America. Mr
Praeger in describing the striking mixture of species
in the west of Ireland writes, 'The pool from which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">« 37 »</a></span>
we gather the American Pipe Wort is fringed with
Pyrenean Heathers. The cracks which are filled with
the delicate green foam of the maiden hair are set in
Bearberry and Spring Gentian; <i>Habenaria intacta</i>,
far from its Mediterranean home, sends up its flower-spikes
through carpets of mountain Avens; and
St Dabeoc's Heath and the dwarf Juniper straggle
together over the rocky knolls'(<a href="#Note_25">25</a>).</p>

<p>The presence of Eriocaulon on the western edge
of Europe may be attributed to migration in pre-Glacial
days from North America by way of a land-connexion,
of which Greenland and Iceland represent
surviving portions. The opinion held by Forbes, and
advocated by some later naturalists, that the southern
companions of Eriocaulon in the west of Ireland are
survivors from a Tertiary flora which have lived
through the Ice Age, is consistently extended to the
Pipe Wort. On the other hand, before yielding to
the temptation to regard these American and Mediterranean
species as links with the Tertiary period,
we must be convinced that the possibilities of
post-Glacial introduction, even without the aid of
land-bridges, have been exhausted. The Pipe Wort
is a botanical puzzle which affords a good example of
the accession of interest to field-botany effected by a
knowledge of the distribution of the component
members of the British flora. The problem of its
past history suggests an experimental enquiry into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">« 38 »</a></span>
the adaptability of its seeds to dispersal, and emphasises
the importance of the co-operation of
botanists and geologists in a common endeavour to
trace the origin of British plants.</p>

<p>In addition to the Pipe Wort, mention may be
made of three other American flowering plants
recognised in the Irish flora. <i>Sisyrinchium angustifolium</i>
recorded from the west of Ireland is native
in temperate North America; the orchid, <i>Spiranthes
romanzoffiana</i>, met with in the south and north of
Ireland, is widely spread in Canada and the northern
States, while <i>Sisyrinchium californicum</i>, a native
of California and Oregon, was discovered by Mr Marshall
in marshy meadow-land near Wexford(<a href="#Note_26">26</a>). In
the case of the more recently discovered American
immigrants, the possibility of human introduction
must be borne in mind, though there are no special
reasons for doubting that some, as in the case of Eriocaulon,
reached the Irish coast by natural agencies.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD</p>

<p class="smaller">'All the Epochs of the Past are only a few of the front carriages,
and probably the least wonderful, in the van of an interminable
procession.'&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="smcap">J. B. Bury</span> (<i>The Science of History</i>).</p>


<p>The portion of the earth's surface accessible to
investigation is made up in part of accumulations
of old sediments, some indistinguishable from the
shingle, sand, and mud now in process of formation
by the ceaseless action of denudation; others have
been hardened, gently folded or violently contorted
and so far altered by crust-movements as to render
their sedimentary origin well nigh unrecognisable.
It is these sediments of former ages, the dust of lost
continents, in which are preserved the majority of
the fragmentary remains of plants and animals, the
flotsam and jetsam of successive phases of evolution.</p>

<p>The crust of the earth, as Darwin wrote, 'with its
imbedded remains must not be looked at as a well
filled museum, but as a poor collection made at
hazard and at rare intervals'(<a href="#Note_19">19</a>). It is from this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">« 40 »</a></span>
imperfect record that we seek to discover the relative
antiquity of the several groups or genera of living
plants, and in the structure of extinct types we
endeavour to discover connecting links between
divisions of the plant kingdom which in the course
of evolution have retained little or no signs of a
common descent.</p>

<p>Sir Joseph Hooker in a letter to Darwin in 1859
speaks of his 'conviction that we have not in a
fossilised condition a fraction of the plants that have
existed, and that not a fraction of those we have are
recognisable specifically'(<a href="#Note_12">12</a>). Considering the nature
of the palaeontological documents the wonder is how
much they have taught us, and we may look with
confidence to the results of future research in a field
of which the importance has only recently been
appreciated. With the strata of sedimentary origin
are frequently associated igneous rocks, and in many
continental regions, as in the majority of oceanic
islands, the crust of the earth consists wholly of
volcanic material or of rocks produced by the gradual
solidification of molten magmas. Rocks composed
mainly of carbonate of lime, such as limestones and
chalk, bear witness to ocean beds or to sediments
deposited on the floors of inland seas beyond the
reach of land detritus where coral reefs were reared
or the shells and other calcareous skeletons of
animals supplied the material for future land. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">« 41 »</a></span>
such rocks the remains of calcareous seaweeds are
frequently recognisable and occasionally, as in the
English chalk, fragments of wood testify to transport
from a distant land.</p>

<p>While there is little difficulty in explaining the
nature of much of the earth's crust, in several parts of
the world the strata are totally unfossiliferous and
closely simulate crystalline rocks. In many cases
it is believed that such strata represent ancient
sediments which in the course of ages have been
reduced by metamorphic agencies to a condition
which has obscured or entirely obliterated all traces
of their pristine state.</p>

<p>Since the pioneer work of William Smith, who
in the early days of the nineteenth century first
realised the importance of fossils as aids to the
determination of relative age, geologists have devoted
themselves to the task of correlating the sedimentary
rocks of the world, using as criteria the order of
superposition of the strata and the nature of their
organic remains. The result has been to classify
portions of the earth's crust into periods or chapters,
which together constitute a record of geological
evolution as complete as it is possible to obtain from
the available data. The accompanying table shows
the order of sequence of the epochs, which stand for
terms of years of a magnitude beyond our powers to
grasp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">« 42 »</a></span></p>

<p>The division of geological history into larger and
smaller periods does not imply the recurrence of
sudden revolutions; it is in some measure dictated
by considerations of convenience, but more particularly
by our ignorance of certain stages in the
history of the world due to the imperfection of the
record.</p>

<p>In certain parts of the world, as for example the
north-west Highlands of Scotland, the Malvern Hills,
Scandinavia, and in many other regions in Europe
and North America, geologists have recognised what
they believe to be the foundation stones of the
world. These Archaean rocks, which underlie the
oldest fossiliferous strata, belong to a period of
geological evolution from which it appears to be
hopeless to obtain any light as to the nature of the
contemporary organic world. The earliest vestiges of
life so far discovered exhibit a high degree of organisation,
which unmistakably points to their being links in
a chain extending far beyond the limits of the oldest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">« 44 »</a></span>
Cambrian strata in which recognisable fossils first
occur. The rocks of the Cambrian and Ordovician
epochs, as represented by the grits, shales, slates
and other sedimentary strata in Wales, Shropshire, the
Lake district and elsewhere, though in places rich in
the remains of animals, afford no information in regard
to the land vegetation. From the succeeding Silurian
epoch very little evidence has been gleaned as to the
nature of the flora, and it is not until we come to the
sedimentary rocks of the Devonian era that records
of plant-life occur in any abundance. The almost
complete lack of botanical data in the pre-Devonian
formations is in part due to the fact that these older
rocks consist to a large extent of marine deposits
formed under conditions unfavourable to the preservation
of plants. That the land-surfaces of the older
Palaeozoic eras supported an abundant vegetation
there can be little doubt. The relics of plant-life
furnished by the Devonian and succeeding formations
represent the upper branching-systems of a deeply
rooted and spreading tree, the lowest portions of
which have been destroyed or have left no sign of
their existence.</p>

<p>In descending the Geological series, we begin with
superficial deposits, such as peat and river-gravels
found subsequently to the underlying boulder-clay of
the Glacial period. The remains of forest trees preserved
in the peat and in submerged forests round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">« 45 »</a></span>
the coast connect the vegetation of the historic period
with that of the Neolithic age. At the base of the
Pleistocene series, the name given to the latest
chapter of geological history, we find evidence of the
prevalence of arctic conditions in the widely spread
boulder-clays and other deposits of the Glacial period.</p>

<p>From deposits of post-Glacial date abundant plant
remains have been obtained, but we cannot say with
any degree of certainty what proportion of these
plants remained in Britain during the Ice age, and
whether the greater part of the vegetation, the relics
of which have been discovered in pre-Glacial beds,
was destroyed or driven south by the advancing ice.
We may briefly consider some of the more interesting
facts brought to light by the investigation of the
fossil plants in the Lower Pleistocene and Upper
Tertiary beds. It is mainly to the researches of
Mr Clement Reid into the vegetation of Britain
immediately preceding the Glacial period, that our
knowledge of this phase of the history of the British
flora is due.</p>

<p>On the coast of Norfolk in the neighbourhood of
Cromer the sections of the cliffs reveal the existence
of a succession of sands, clays, and gravels underlying
Glacial deposits; this material was probably laid
down near the mouth of the ancient Rhine, which in
the latter part of the Tertiary period flowed across
a low area, which is now occupied by the shallow
southern half of the North Sea(<a href="#Note_27">27</a>). The plant-fragments
found in these river-sediments indicate a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">« 47 »</a></span>
temperate climate. Among the plants of this pre-Glacial
flora are many familiar British species, such as
<i>Caltha palustris</i> (marsh marigold), species of butter-cup,
<i>Stellaria holostea</i> (greater stichwort) (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3, C</a>),
<i>Bidens tripartita</i> (bur-marigold) (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3, A</a>), maple,
hawthorn, the alder, hazel, the yew, Scots pine and
numerous others. If, as is not improbable, these
pre-Glacial plants were swept away by the subsequent
arctic conditions, the great majority of them returned
to their old home when a warmer climate ensued.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">« 48 »</a></span>
There are however some pre-Glacial plants, such as
the spruce fir (<i>Picea excelsa</i>), a cone of which is
shown in <a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3, B</a>, the water chestnut, <i>Trapa natans</i>
(<a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>), and a few other species no longer represented
in the British flora. The genus <i>Trapa</i> is
a striking example of a flowering plant which has
disappeared since the Tertiary period from many
parts of Europe, including England, most of Sweden,
and from several regions in northern Europe. It still
grows in a few localities in Switzerland and in some
of the Italian lakes. In pre-Glacial times the water
chestnut was widely spread from Portugal and England
in the west to Siberia in the east, and its hard four-pronged
nuts have been recorded from many post-Glacial
peat-moors in the north of Europe.</p>

<p>From the so-called Cromer forest-bed and associated
deposits on the Norfolk coast several
pre-Glacial plants have been obtained, indicating
a temperate climate during this phase of the
Pleistocene period. A few arctic species, such as
the dwarf birch and arctic willow obtained from the
deposits next above the Cromer forest-bed, herald
the near approach of glacial conditions.</p>

<p>It may be remarked in passing that no satisfactory
evidence has been discovered in Britain of the
existence of man in this part of Europe in pre-Glacial
days: it is, however, believed that flints from
Tertiary strata on the continent show traces of human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">« 49 »</a></span>
workmanship. As Sir Edwin Ray Lankester said in
1905, 'It is not improbable that it was in the remote
period known as the Lower Miocene&mdash;remote as compared
with the gravels in which Eoliths [primitive
stone implements] occur&mdash;that Natural Selection
began to favour that increase in the size of the brain
of a large and not very powerful semi-erect ape'(<a href="#Note_28">28</a>).</p>

<p>Though comparatively recent in terms of geological
chronology, the remoteness, according to ordinary
conceptions of time, of the Tertiary period is brought
home to us when we endeavour to grasp the fact
that it was during this chapter in the earth's history
that some of our highest mountain-ranges, such as
the Alps, the Carpathians, and Himalayas were formed
by the uplifting of piles of marine sediments. From
Tertiary strata in the Isle of Wight, on the Hampshire
coast, and in the London basin numerous fossil
plants have been obtained, which afford convincing
evidence of climatic conditions much more genial
than those of the present day. The presence of palm
leaves and of a wealth of other sub-tropical plants
in Lower Tertiary beds in England reveals the
existence of a flora differing considerably both from
that in the uppermost Tertiary beds of Norfolk and
from the modern British flora, but closely allied to
the present Mediterranean flora.</p>

<p>The basaltic columns of the Giants' Causeway and
of the Staffa Cave, and the terraced rocks which form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">« 50 »</a></span>
so characteristic a feature in the contours of the
Inner Hebrides, are portions of lava-flows, which in
the early days of the Tertiary period were poured
out over a wide area of land stretching from the
north-east of Ireland, through the Western isles of
Scotland, the Faroë islands, to Iceland and Greenland.
While in this northern region volcanic activity was
being manifested on a stupendous scale, a shallow
sea extended over part of what is now the south-east
of England in which was deposited a considerable
thickness of sedimentary material derived from the
neighbouring land. In this upraised sea-floor, known
as the London clay, which is exposed in the Isle of
Sheppey and in many other localities, numerous fossil
fruits and fragments of wood occur in association
with marine shells. The fact that many of the fruits
were ripe at the time of their entombment led some
eighteenth century writers to assign an autumn date
to the universal deluge. One of the Sheppey fruits
may be mentioned as an especially interesting sample
of the early Tertiary flora, namely the genus Nipadites,
so named from the very close resemblance of
the fossils to the fruits of the existing tropical plant
Nipa. <i>Nipa fruticans</i>, sometimes described as a
stemless palm because of the absence of the erect
stem which is usually a characteristic feature of
palms, grows in brackish estuaries of many tropical
countries (<a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5, A</a>): it has long leaves not unlike
those of the date-palm and bears clusters of fruits
as large as a man's head; a single fruit is two or
three inches long and its hard fibrous shell is characterised
by four or five longitudinal ribs (<a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5, B</a>).
The fruits of Nipa, which may be carried a considerable
distance by ocean-currents without losing the
power of germination, are constantly found with other
vegetable drift on the beaches of tropical islands. The
discovery of fruits of Nipa (or Nipadites), hardly
distinguishable from those of the existing species,
in Tertiary beds in England, Belgium, in the Paris
basin, and in Egypt affords a striking instance of
changes in the geographical distribution of an ancient
plant now restricted to warmer regions.</p>

<p>While the higher members of the Cretaceous
system, as seen in the chalk cliffs and downs, represent
the upraised calcareous accumulations on
the floor of a fairly deep and clear sea, the lower
members testify to shallower water within reach of
river-borne sand and mud. 'During the Chalk
period,' as Huxley wrote, 'not one of the present
great physical features of the globe was in existence.
Our great mountain ranges, Pyrenees, Alps, Himalayas,
Andes, have all been upheaved since the
chalk was deposited, and the Cretaceous sea flowed
over the sites of Sinai and Ararat'(<a href="#Note_29">29</a>).</p>

<p>The Wealden strata, at the base of the Cretaceous
system, as seen on the Sussex coast, in parts of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">« 53 »</a></span>
Isle of Wight, in the Weald district of Kent and
neighbouring counties, point to the existence of a
lake over a portion of the south of England and of
the English Channel. The remains of a rich Wealden
flora have been collected from these Wealden sediments,
notably from the plant-beds of Ecclesbourne
near Hastings, in which, so far as we know, flowering
plants played no part or at most occupied a very
subordinate position. A few fossil leaves have been
described from rocks assigned to a Wealden age,&mdash;and
from the older Stonesfield Slate, of Jurassic
age, a single leaf is recorded,&mdash;which seem to be
those of Dicotyledons; but it is certain that even in
the early days of the Cretaceous period the present
dominant group in the plant kingdom was in its
infancy and in many regions probably unrepresented.
When we glance at the geological table and consider
that in all the floras from the Wealden down to the
Devonian period, flowering plants played no part,
we are able to appreciate the fact of their rapid
development, referred to in a previous chapter, when
once this highest type had become established.</p>

<p>The rocks comprised in the Jurassic system extend
from East Yorkshire to the coast of Dorsetshire; they
consist of a succession of limestones, clays, sandstones,
and a few thin beds of impure coal. Sediments of
this age also occur, though to a much less extent,
on the north-east coast of Scotland and in a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">« 54 »</a></span>
places in the Inner Hebrides. Many of the Jurassic
strata contain only marine shells, and corals are
occasionally abundant, though in the lower members
of the system in the cliffs near Lyme Regis and at
Whitby fossil plants are fairly common. It is, however,
from the middle Jurassic beds, in the cliffs
between Whitby and Scarborough, and in some
inland quarries in East Yorkshire, that we have
obtained the richest Jurassic flora. Rivers from a
northern land laden with sediment and carrying drift-wood,
leaves and other plant fragments, deposited
their burden in an estuary which occupied the eastern
edge of Yorkshire. Sedimentary rocks laid down
towards the close of the Jurassic period in the island
of Portland in the south and on the Sutherland coast
in the north have furnished valuable records of
plant-life.</p>

<p>The passage from the Jurassic to the underlying
Triassic system is formed by some shales and limestones
in South Wales containing remains of fish and
other marine organisms. These so-called Rhaetic
beds are poorly represented in the British area, but
on the continent of Europe and in other regions the
sediments of this age bulk much more largely and
have yielded a rich collection of plants. The rocks
of the upper division of the Triassic system, as seen
in the Midlands, point to the prevalence of desert
conditions; and in the grooved sand-polished surfaces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">« 55 »</a></span>
of granite in Charnwood forest we have a glimpse of
a Triassic landscape. The salt-bearing strata of this
period in Cheshire and Worcestershire suggest conditions
paralleled at the present day in the Caspian
and Dead-Sea regions. The vegetation of Britain, and
indeed of the world as a whole, seems to have undergone
but little change during the enormous lapse of
time represented by the sediments comprised between
the Wealden and Triassic periods. The Lower Triassic
flora affords evidence of a change in the facies of the
vegetation and prepares us for the still greater differences
revealed by a study of the Permian and
Carboniferous floras. To the student of evolution
these Palaeozoic floras are of special interest on
account of the facts they have contributed in regard
to the descent and inter-relationship of different
branches of the vegetable kingdom.</p>

<p>It is by a patient study of the waifs and strays
of the vegetation of successive phases of the world's
history preserved in sedimentary strata, that it has
been possible to follow the history of many existing
plants and to establish links between the present
and the past.</p>

<p class="smaller">'Some whim of Nature locked them fast in stone for us afterthoughts
of Creation.'&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="smcap">Lowell.</span></p>


<p>The failure of the earlier naturalists to grasp the
true significance of fossils or even to appreciate their
nature is an extraordinary fact when we consider the
pioneer work which they accomplished in biological
and geological science. The following extract from
the writings of so enlightened a man as John Ray
serves to illustrate an almost incredible disinclination
to admit what seems to us the obvious. He wrote:&mdash;'Yet
I must not dissemble that there is a Phenomenon
in Nature, which doth somewhat puzzle us to
reconcile with the prudence observable in all its
work, and seems strongly to prove, that Nature doth
sometimes <i>ludere</i>, and delineates figures, for no other
end, but for the ornament of some stone, and to
entertain or gratify our curiosity, and exercise our
wits. This is, those elegant impressions of leaves and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">« 57 »</a></span>
plants upon cole-slate, the knowledge of which,
I must confess myself to leave to my learned and
ingenious friend Mr Edward Lhwyd of Oxford.... He
told me that Mr Woodward, a Londoner, shewed
him very good draughts of the common female fern,
naturally formed in cole.... But these figures are more
diligently to be observed and considered... Dr Woodward
will have them to be the impressions of the
leaves of plants which were there lodged at the time
of the Deluge'(<a href="#Note_31">31</a>).</p>

<p>The Mr Woodward alluded to by Ray thus
expressed his views on fossils in an <i>Essay towards
the Natural History of the Earth</i>:&mdash;'The whole
terrestrial globe was taken all to pieces and dissolved
at the Deluge, the particles of stone, marble, and
all solid fossils dissevered, taken up into the water,
and then sustained together with sea shells and other
animal and vegetable bodies; the present earth
consists and was formed out of that promiscuous mass
of sand, earth, shells, and the rest falling down again,
and subsiding from the water'(<a href="#Note_32">32</a>).</p>

<p>In the later part of the seventeenth-century
Steno, a Dane by birth and Professor of Anatomy at
Padua, by his recognition of the identity of the teeth
in a shark's head, which he had dissected, with some
fossils from Malta known as Glossopetrae, established
the true nature of fossils. He also recognised a
certain orderly sequence in fossiliferous strata, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">« 58 »</a></span>
in the opinion of Professor Sollas he is entitled to
be considered the 'Father and Founder' of Geology(<a href="#Note_33">33</a>).</p>

<p>It was by slow degrees that the early observers
freed themselves from the obsession that the remains
of animals and plants in the earth's crust bear witness
to a Universal Deluge and are all identical with
existing species. The possibility that some of the
fossil plants in English strata might be more clearly
related to forms now met with in warmer regions
was gradually realised. The publication of the
<i>Origin of Species</i> stimulated palaeontological
research, and botanists as well as zoologists turned
to the investigation of extinct genera in search of
proofs of the doctrine of evolution.</p>

<p>The common occurrence of petrified wood in
rocks of different ages is well known. Fossil stems
are occasionally found in their natural position of
growth, the structural details being rendered permanent
by the deposition of siliceous or calcareous
material from water drawn by capillarity into the
dead but still sound tissues. Petrified wood from
Upper Jurassic beds is abundant in the Island of
Purbeck; an unusually long piece of stem may be
seen in the small town of Portland fixed to the wall
of a house. Some of these stems have been referred
by an American author to the Araucarian family of
Conifers, but the structure is as a rule hardly well
enough preserved to afford satisfactory evidence for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">« 59 »</a></span>
identification. In his <i>Testimony of the Rocks</i>, Hugh
Miller speaks of fossil wood from the upper beds of
the Jurassic system in sufficient abundance on the
beach at Helmsdale in Sutherlandshire to be collected
in cart-loads; it is still easy to pick up good specimens
on the shingle beach a short distance north of
Helmsdale, and a recent microscopical examination
showed that some specimens are pieces of an Araucarian
tree.</p>

<p>Impressive examples of petrified trees on a
large scale are to be seen in the United States,
in Arizona and the Yellowstone Park. (Frontispiece.)
In the northern part of Arizona the country for over
an area of 10 square miles is covered with tree trunks,
some reaching 200 feet in length and a diameter of
10 feet. The nature of the mineralising substance has
given rise to the name Chalcedony Park for this
Triassic forest(<a href="#Note_34">34</a>). A striking example of one of the
Arizona trees is exhibited in the British Museum and
in a neighbouring case is a splendid petrified stem, 9 ft.
in height, of a conifer discovered in Tertiary lavas in
Tasmania(<a href="#Note_35">35</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">« 61 »</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#Fig_6">Figure 6</a> illustrates the preservation of a series
of forests of Tertiary age in the mass of volcanic
sediments, 2000 feet in thickness, known as Amethyst
mountain, in the Yellowstone Park district. By the
weathering away of the surrounding volcanic material
the tall stems of the trees are exposed in places on
the mountain sides like the 'columns of a ruined
temple.' The height of the river at the foot of the
cliff is 6700 ft. above sea-level and the mountain
rises to a height of 9400 ft. above the sea. In the
lower part of the section the volcanic strata are seen
to rest on a foundation of older rocks <i>A</i>, and these
in turn were laid down on the eroded surface of a
still more ancient foundation, <i>B</i>(<a href="#Note_36">36</a>).</p>

<p>The section as a whole affords a striking demonstration
of the magnitude of earth-movements since
the last of these forests was buried below the
surface of a sea in which the volcanic material was
deposited. The account of the Yellowstone Park
section recalls Darwin's description in the <i>Naturalist's
Voyage</i>(<a href="#Note_37">37</a>) of snow-white columns projecting
from a bare slope, at an altitude of 7000 ft. in the
Cordillera.</p>

<p>The abundance of drift-wood on the coasts of
some countries at the present day helps us to picture
the conditions under which the remains of former
forests have been preserved. In his <i>Letters from
High Latitudes</i>, Lord Dufferin gives the following
description of drift-wood on the shores of Spitzbergen:&mdash;'A
little to the northward, I observed,
lying on the sea-shore innumerable logs of drift-wood.
This wood is floated all the way from America by the
Gulf Stream, and as I walked from one huge bole
to another, I could not help wondering in what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">« 62 »</a></span>
primeval forest each had grown, what chance had
originally cast them on the waters, and piloted
them to this desert shore'(<a href="#Note_38">38</a>). A photograph reproduced
in Amundsen's book on <i>The North West
Passage</i> shows the beach on the Alaskan coast
strewn with drifted timber(<a href="#Note_39">39</a>). For the accompanying
photograph (<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>) of the flood-plain of the Colorado
River(<a href="#Note_40">40</a>), I am indebted to Professor MacDougal of
the Desert Research Laboratory at Tucson, Arizona,
who in a recent letter writes, 'During times of high-water
a thin sheet of flood covers the flat for many
miles and bears drift-wood so thickly that it is
difficult to push a boat through it.' The drift-wood
consists of poplar, willow, pine, and juniper, 'the last
two have been brought from the upper river, from
as far away as a thousand miles.' A picture such as
this affords an admirable example of the wealth
of material available for preservation in a fossil state.</p>

<p>It is only in the minority of cases that the
accidents of preservation of fragments of ancient
floras have given us the means of investigating the
internal structure of the plant organs. It is far more
frequently the case that fossil plants are represented
only by a carbonised film on the surface of a piece of
shale or other rock: the actual substance of the
plant has been converted into a thin layer of coal,
and though the venation and other surface-features
may be clearly revealed, the internal tissues have
been destroyed. If a lump of clay containing a
piece of fern frond is heated, the result is an impression
of the leaf on the hardened matrix and a
coaly substance in place of the plant substance. It
is occasionally possible by detaching a piece of the
black film from a fossil, and heating it with nitric
acid and chlorate of potash and then dipping it in
ammonia, to obtain a transparent preparation suitable
for microscopical examination of the cell-outlines
of the superficial layer of the leaf or other plant-fragment.
This method of examination, used by
several students of fossil plants and with conspicuous
success by Professor Nathorst of Stockholm, often
affords valuable aids to identification.</p>

<p>Pieces of plants embedded in sandy sediment,
if not preserved by petrifaction, that is by the
introduction into the tissues of some siliceous
or calcareous solution, gradually decay and their
fragmentary remains may be washed away by
percolating water, leaving a hollow mould in the
gradually hardening sediment, which is afterwards
filled with sand or other material. The plant itself
is destroyed, but a cast is taken which in the case
of fine-grained sediments reproduces the form and
surface-pattern of the original specimen. The incrustation
of plants by the falsely named petrifying
springs of Knaresborough and other places illustrate
another method of fossilisation.</p>

<p>Plants which owe their preservation to amber
occur both as incrustations and petrifactions. This
fossil resin occurs in Tertiary, Cretaceous, and
Jurassic rocks; the amber found in abundance on
the Baltic coast near Danzig and occasionally picked
up on the beach in Norfolk and Suffolk comes from
beds of Tertiary age. Pieces of Pine-wood have been
described from the Baltic beds in which the tissues
are perfectly preserved as the result of the conversion
into amber of the resinous secretion which permeates
their cells: in this case the amber is a petrifying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">« 66 »</a></span>
agent. More frequently the preservation is due to
incrustation; as resin trickled down the stems of the
Tertiary pines from an open wound, flowers and
leaves, blown by the wind on to the sticky surface,
were eventually sealed up in a translucent case of
amber. Though the actual substance may have gone,
the mould which remains exhibits in wonderful perfection
each separate organ of a flower or the
delicate hair-clusters on the surface of a leaf. The
flower represented in <a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>, a species of Cinnamon,
is one of several specimens described by the authors
of a monograph of Tertiary plants in the Baltic
amber(<a href="#Note_41">41</a>).</p>

<p>The fragments of plants preserved in nodules of
calcareous rock occasionally met with in some of the
Lancashire and Yorkshire coal-seams are perhaps
the most striking examples of the possibilities of
petrifaction. By cutting sections of these nodules
and grinding them to a transparent thinness, the
most delicate tissues of Carboniferous plants are
rendered accessible to investigation under the high
power of a microscope. As our attention is absorbed
by the examination of the details of cell-structure
it is easy to forget that the section has not been
cut from a living plant, but from the twig of a
tree which grew in the forests of the Coal age. The
preservation is such as to enable us not only to
describe the anatomy of these extinct types of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">« 67 »</a></span>
vegetation, but, by the application of the knowledge
of the relation between the structure of the plant-machine
and its functions gained by a study of living
species, it is possible in some degree to picture the
plants of the Coal period as living organisms and
to see in the structural framework a reflection of
external environment. The recognition in the general
architectural plan of the Palaeozoic plants, as in
many of the finer anatomical features, of the closest
resemblance to plants of the modern world produces
an almost overwhelming sense of continuity between
the past and the present.</p>

<p>The plants of the Palaeozoic period, though often
differing considerably from those of the same class
in the floras of to-day, exhibit a remarkably high type
of organisation. Some of the most abundant trees in
the forest of the Coal age are decidedly superior
in the complexity of their structure, as also in
size, to modern survivals of the same stock. On
the other hand, it must be remembered that Monocotyledons
and Dicotyledons which now occupy the
highest place in the hierarchy of plants have left no
sign of their existence in any of the Palaeozoic strata.
The greater size of some of the Palaeozoic plants,
and in some respects the more advanced stage of
evolution which they represent as compared with
their nearest relatives of the present era, must be
considered in relation to their more important and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">« 68 »</a></span>
relatively higher position in the plant-world than
that which is now held by their diminutive descendants.
It is, however, impossible to get away
from the conclusion that the oldest Palaeozoic flora
of which we have an intimate knowledge must be
the product of development of an age which is
represented by a chapter in the history of the plant
kingdom at least as far removed from the beginning
as it is separated from the chapter now being written.
Examples might be quoted in illustration of the risks
attending the determination of fossils by means of
external features alone, but it may suffice to mention
the case of a specimen originally described as a
fragment of a Cretaceous Dinosaur under the name
<i>Aachenosaurus multidens</i>. By the examination of
thin sections this supposed bone was shown to be
a piece of Dicotyledonous wood(<a href="#Note_42">42</a>). The methods of
preservation of plants as fossils are numerous and
varied and the few examples selected give but an
incomplete idea of the subject: for a fuller treatment
of fossilisation the reader is referred to more technical
treatises (48 vol. <span class="smcap">I</span>.).</p>

<p>The employment of fossil plants as 'Thermometers
of the ages' is a branch of Palaeobotany to which a
passing allusion may be permitted though it is only
indirectly connected with the main question. As
one of the most interesting examples of changed
climatic conditions revealed by a study of fossil plants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">« 69 »</a></span>
reference may be made to the wealth of material
collected within the Arctic circle. The problems
suggested by the discovery of plants in rocks of
various ages in North Siberia, Spitzbergen, Franz
Josef Land, Bear Island, Greenland, and in many
other localities in the far north are too difficult
and far-reaching to be discussed in these pages. In
the Cretaceous and Tertiary strata of the west coast
of Greenland and Disco Island from 69&deg; to 72&deg; north
latitude, to refer only to one case, a great number
of plants have been obtained by several of the earlier
Arctic explorers and more recently by members of
one of the Peary Expeditions. At the present day
on the fringe of land on the western edge of Greenland
which is not permanently covered with ice,
a considerable number of herbaceous plants are able
to exist and to produce seed during their concentrated
period of development; while trees are represented
only by a few low-growing shrubs such as the dwarf
Juniper. In places accessible to investigation beyond
the ice-covered hills of northern Greenland the rocks
have been shown to consist of Cretaceous and Tertiary
sediments containing fossil plants associated with
seams of coal. From these beds numerous Dicotyledons
have been obtained, some of them almost
identical with living species characteristic of sub-tropical
or tropical countries. In the lowest of the
Cretaceous series no Dicotyledons have been found,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">« 70 »</a></span>
but flowering plants are abundant in the higher
Cretaceous rocks. Allowing for the fact that closely
allied species are often able to live under very
different climatic conditions, there can be no doubt
that the Cretaceous and Tertiary floras of Greenland
indicate an average temperature considerably higher
than that which now prevails in the warmest parts
of the British Isles.</p>

<p>In the far south a fairly rich Jurassic flora has
recently been discovered by the members of a
Swedish Antarctic expedition in Graham's Land in
latitude 63&deg;·15 S. and longitude 57&deg; W., which in its
general facies bears a close resemblance to the
Jurassic flora of Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Although the great majority of the records of
ancient plants are difficult to interpret by reason
of imperfect preservation and because of the frequent
separation of leaves, stems, and reproductive organs,
the student who tries to piece together the <i>disjecta
membra</i> of the floras of the past shares the opinion
expressed by the late Marquis of Saporta,&mdash;'Si l'on
s'attache à les déchiffrer, on oublie bien vite la

<p>The Ferns as a whole represent a section of the
vegetable kingdom which traces its ancestry as far
into the past as any group of plants. Impressions of
leaves on the shales of the Coal-measures and on
rocks of the earlier Devonian period are hardly
distinguishable in form and in the venation and
shape of the leaflets from the finely divided fronds
of modern ferns. Until a few years ago these
Palaeozoic fossils were generally regarded as true
ferns, and it was believed that ferns played a conspicuous
part in the vegetation of the earliest periods,
of which we have any botanical knowledge. Conclusions
based on external form must frequently be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">« 72 »</a></span>
revised in the light of more trustworthy evidence.
It was shown in the later part of the nineteenth
century by the late Professor Williamson of Manchester,
whose researches into the plants of the
Coal age shed a flood of light on the ancestry and
inter-relationship of many existing plants, that some
of the fern-like leaves which have long been familiar
to those who search among the shales of the refuse
heaps of collieries, were borne on stems differing in
anatomical features from those of any known fern.
The investigation of the structure of the leaves and
their supporting stems led to the recognition of
certain extinct genera of Palaeozoic plants of exceptional
interest, to which the term generalised type is
aptly applied. Associated with anatomical and other
characters such as we now regard as the attributes
of ferns, these plants exhibit other features not met
with in modern ferns but characteristic of a group of
seed-bearing plants known as the Cycads. Recent
research has revealed the existence of several such
generalised types which, by their combination of
characters now met with in distinct sub-divisions
of the plant-kingdom, clearly indicate the derivation
of Ferns, and Cycads as we know them to-day, from
a common stock. It was in the first instance by
means of anatomical evidence&mdash;obtained by the
microscopical examination of sections of petrified
fragments of stems and leaves&mdash;that the generalised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">« 73 »</a></span>
nature of these Palaeozoic plants was recognised.
Nothing was known as to the reproductive organs.
Ferns as now represented in the floras of the
world are essentially seed-less plants. As the author
of <i>Hudibras</i> wrote:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Who would believe what strange bugbears<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Mankind creates itself, of fears?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That spring like fern, that insect weed,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Equivocally, without seed.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The reproductive organs or spores borne on the
fronds of a fern produce, on germination, a thin
green structure, known as the prothallus, less than
an inch in length: this bears the sexual organs, and as
the result of the union of the male and female cells,
the embryo fern-plant begins its existence as a parasite
on the inconspicuous prothallus, until after unfolding
its first green leaf and thrusting a slender root into
the ground, it starts its career as an independent
organism<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. In this life-cycle the seed plays no
part.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The life-history of a Fern is clearly described by Prof. Bower
in a recent volume in this series.</p></div>

<p>It is noteworthy that the absence of any indication
of spore-capsules and spores, in the case of some of
the supposed fern leaves from the Coal-measures,
caused some suspicion in the mind of an Austrian
Palaeobotanist as to the right of such specimens to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">« 74 »</a></span>
be classed among the ferns. This opinion, based in
the first place on negative evidence and but little
regarded by other authors, has in recent years
been proved correct. In 1904 a paper was read
before the Royal Society by Professor Oliver and
Dr Scott(<a href="#Note_43">43</a>) in which evidence was brought forward
pointing to the conclusion that one of these
generalised plants bore true seeds. Subsequently
Dr Kidston published an account of some specimens
of another of these Palaeozoic plants in which was
actually shown an organic connexion between undoubted
seeds and pieces of a fern-like frond(<a href="#Note_44">44</a>).
Without entering into further details, these and
similar discoveries may be summarised as follows:&mdash;Many
of the supposed Fern-fronds of Palaeozoic
age, particularly those characteristic of the Coal-measures,
are the leaves of plants which in their
anatomical characters combined features now shared
by true Ferns and by the Cycads. The reproductive
organs of these Palaeozoic genera differed widely
from those of existing ferns; the male organs, while
not unlike the spore-capsules and spores of certain
ferns, recall the male organs of living Conifers and
Cycads, and the female organs were represented by
seeds of a highly complex form. These seed-bearing
plants have been called Pteridosperms, a name
which expresses the combination of fern-like features
with one of the distinguishing attributes of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">« 75 »</a></span>
higher plants, namely the possession of seeds. The
ancestors of Pteridosperms are as yet unknown; it
is, however, reasonable to assume that there existed
in some pre-Carboniferous epoch a group of simple
plants from which both Ferns and Pteridosperms
were derived. In the forests of the Coal age true
Ferns probably occupied a subordinate position in
relation to the Pteridosperms.</p>

<p>The question of the relationship between different
families of recent ferns and the older known fossil
members of the group is beyond the scope of this
book. Evidence has been discovered in recent years
which warrants the statement that, although none of
those Carboniferous ferns were generically identical
with existing forms, they very clearly foreshadowed
some of those structural features which characterise
more than one family of present-day Ferns. The
records of the older Mesozoic formations afford
abundant evidence of the existence of certain types
of Ferns showing a very close resemblance to recent
species.</p>

<p>An enquiry into the geographical distribution of
living Ferns reveals facts of special interest in
connexion with the relative antiquity of different
genera and families. The wide distribution of the
Bracken fern has already been referred to: it is
abundant in Tasmania; its vigour in the island
is well illustrated by Mr Geoffrey Smith's statement
that constant attention is necessary to keep it from
invading newly opened country(<a href="#Note_45">45</a>). On Mount Ophir
in the Malay Peninsula the cosmopolitan bracken
occurs in association with the two genera Matonia
and Dipteris, ferns which are among the most striking
examples of links with a remote past and have a
restricted geographical range. With <i>Osmunda regalis</i>,
the Royal Fern, the Bracken is conspicuous
in the marsh vegetation of the Bermudas; it flourishes
on the Atlas Mountains, in the Canary Islands, in
Abyssinia, on Mt Kenia, in British East Africa, in
the Himalayas, and is in fact generally distributed in
the tropics in both the north and south temperate
zones.</p>

<p>The Royal Fern (<a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>) is another British species
with a wide distribution; it occurs in Northern Asia
and in North America; it is common in the Siberian
forests and lives in several tropical countries, extending
to Southern India and Cape Colony, and in
South America it is represented by a closely allied
species. Though at the present day <i>Osmunda regalis</i>
is one of the rare English Ferns, its occurrence in the
submerged forest-beds round our coasts and in pre-Glacial
beds points to its former abundance in the
British area generally. The Royal Fern is a member
of a family now represented by two genera, Osmunda
and Todea.</p>

<p>With the exception of <i>Todea barbara</i>, with its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">« 78 »</a></span>
large spreading fronds and a short root-covered stem,
which occurs in Australia and Cape Colony, all the
species of this genus are filmy ferns with semitransparent
fronds adapted to a moisture-laden
atmosphere. The maximum development of the genus is in New Zealand.</p>

<p><i>Todea barbara</i> affords an instance of discontinuous
distribution; it was no doubt once widely spread in
circumpolar regions and now survives only in South
Africa and in Australia.</p>

<p>There are satisfactory reasons for regarding the
Bracken Fern, with its world-wide range in present-day
floras, as a comparatively modern species now in
full vigour. Its anatomical and other features are
consistent with the view that it is a late product of
evolution, and as yet no indication has been given by
the records of the rocks of an ancient lineage. The
Osmunda family, on the other hand, is undoubtedly
an extremely old branch of the fern group. A comparison
of the Royal Fern with the Bracken shows
that their stems are constructed on very different
plans, and we have good reasons for speaking of the
structural peculiarities of the former as those of
a more primitive type. Moreover, the discontinuous
geographical range of some members of the Osmunda
family is in itself an indication of antiquity. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">« 79 »</a></span>
is another point which may have a bearing in this
question of antiquity, namely the fact that the spores
of Osmunda are green and do not possess the powers
of indurance inherent in the spores of the majority of
ferns which are not green. It has recently been contended
by Professor Campbell of Stanford University
that the delicate green spores of the Liverworts,
plants closely allied to the Mosses, constitute an
argument in favour of the antiquity of these plants(<a href="#Note_46">46</a>).
Certain Liverworts are cosmopolitan in their range,
<i>e.g.</i> the genera Riccia and Marchantia.</p>

<p>If certain genera are widely distributed, notwithstanding
the fact that their reproductive cells, by
which dispersal is effected, are ill-adapted to withstand
unfavourable conditions or to endure prolonged
desiccation, it would seem reasonable to conclude
that their emigration has been accomplished slowly
and with difficulty. Ferns such as Osmunda, with
green and short-lived spores, would thus be handicapped
in competition with other genera provided
with more efficient means of dispersal and better
equipped for the vicissitudes of travel.</p>

<p>The inferences as to antiquity deduced from a
study of the existing species of Osmunda and Todea
receive striking confirmation from the testimony of
fossils. Some of the oldest known Palaeozoic ferns,
though differing too widely from the existing Osmundas
and Todeas to be included in the same family, afford
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">« 80 »</a></span>
distinct glimmerings of Osmundaceous characters,
which at a later period became individualised in
the direct ancestors of the modern forms. Our
knowledge of the past history of the Osmunda family
has recently been considerably extended and placed
on a firmer basis by the researches of Dr Kidston
and Professor Gwynne-Vaughan. These authors have
recognised in some exceptionally well-preserved fern-stems
from Permian rocks in Russia, anatomical
features which point unmistakably to close relationship
with the recent members of the family(<a href="#Note_47">47</a>)(<a href="#Note_48">48</a>).</p>

<p>Passing higher up the geological series, fertile
fern fronds with spore-capsules and spores practically
identical with those of Osmunda have been found in
the Jurassic plant-beds of Yorkshire and in rocks
of approximately the same age in many parts of the
world. From Jurassic strata in New Zealand a
petrified fern-stem has been described (<i>Osmundites
Dunlopi</i>), almost identical in structure with the
surviving species. Cretaceous and Tertiary examples
of similar ferns might be quoted; but enough has
been said to establish the claim of the Royal Fern
and other members of the Osmunda-family to an
ancestry which possibly extends even farther back
than that of any other existing family of Ferns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">« 81 »</a></span></p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 384px;">

<div class="fig_caption"><a name="Fig_10"></a>Fig. 10. <i>Gleichenia dicarpa</i> Br. (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> nat. size.)</div>
</div>

<p>A brief reference may be made to another fern now
represented by several species widely disseminated
in tropical and sub-tropical countries. The genus
Gleichenia occurs abundantly in the warmer regions
of both the Old and New World. The fronds may
usually be recognised by their habit of growth
(<a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a>); in several species the main axis is
repeatedly forked and a small bud between the
divergent branches of the forks forms a characteristic
feature. The leaflets are either long and narrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">« 82 »</a></span>
like the teeth of a comb or short and bluntly rounded.
Moreover the anatomy of the creeping stem affords
a ready means of identification. We have satisfactory
evidence of the occurrence of Gleichenia in European
floras during both the Jurassic and Cretaceous
periods. Numerous fragments of plants were obtained
some years ago, not far from Brussels, from the Wealden
strata in which the famous skeletons of Iguanodon
were discovered. Visitors to the Natural History
Museum in Brussels are no doubt familiar with the
skeletons of this enormous herbivorous animal: in
the same gallery are exhibited the remains of the
fossil plants from the Iguanodon beds. Some of
these fragments are pieces of fern fronds identical
in form with those of existing Gleichenias. The
microscopical examination of some exceptionally well
preserved fragments of Wealden stems discovered by
Prof. Bommer of Brussels enabled him to recognise
the Gleichenia type of structure and thus to confirm
the inconclusive evidence furnished by fragmentary
leaves. The most interesting records in regard to
the former occurrence of Gleichenia in Northern
Europe we owe to the late Oswald Heer of Zurich,
who has described many examples of Gleichenia
fronds from rocks of Lower Cretaceous age in
Disco Island on the west coast of Greenland in
latitude 70&deg; N. The same type of fern is recorded
also from upper Jurassic beds in the north-east of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">« 83 »</a></span>
Scotland, in the Wealden rocks of Sussex, as well as
from other European localities. It is clear that the
Gleichenia-family, no longer represented in north
temperate floras, was in the Jurassic period, and
especially in the early days of the Cretaceous period,
widely spread in Europe, extending well within the
Arctic circle. It may be that the original home of
Gleichenia was in the far North at a time when
climatic conditions were very different from those
which now prevail. Gleichenia, like many other
northern plants, retreated to more southern regions
where, in the warmer countries of the world, many
species still flourish widely separated in space and
time from the place of their birth.</p>

<p>The ferns so far mentioned have a more or less
extended distribution at the present day. In the
case of <i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>, the cosmopolitan
Bracken Fern, wide range would seem to be correlated
with comparatively recent origin; on the
other hand, the facts of palaeobotany show that
the wide distribution of Osmunda, a type of fern
which differs in many important respects from
members of the family (Polypodiaceae) to which
the Bracken belongs, is not inconsistent with an
exceptionally ancient family-history. There are,
however, certain genera of ferns which afford
remarkable examples of restricted geographical
distribution associated with great antiquity. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">« 84 »</a></span>
island of Juan Fernandez, 420 miles off the coast
of Chili, the home for four years of Alexander
Selkirk (to whose adventures we owe Defoe's
creation of Robinson Crusoe), is interesting also
from a botanical point of view. The vegetation of
this oceanic island, 20 square miles in area with
basaltic cliffs rising to a height of 3000 ft. above
the sea, includes more than 40 species of ferns,
eight of which occur nowhere else. One of these
endemic ferns is <i>Thyrsopteris elegans</i>, the only
representative of the genus; it is readily distinguished
by its large and graceful fertile fronds, examples of
which may occasionally be seen on a plant of this
species in the Royal Gardens at Kew: the sporangia
are produced in circular cups which replace the
ordinary leaflets on the lower branches of the frond
and hang from the short axis like miniature clusters
of grapes. It is noteworthy that among the fragmentary
remains of the fern vegetation of the Jurassic
flora in England and in other parts of Europe
specimens occur with fertile segments practically
identical with those of the Juan Fernandez species.
Students of fossil plants are occasionally led away
by the temptation to identify imperfect specimens
with rare existing species to which they exhibit a
superficial resemblance, and this is well illustrated
by the frequent use of the generic name Thyrsopteris
for Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous ferns which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">« 85 »</a></span>
too imperfect to be determined with any degree of
certainty We have, however, satisfactory grounds
for the assertion that the Juan Fernandez fern
affords a striking confirmation of the truth of
Darwin's dictum that 'Rarity, as geology tells us,
is the precursor to extinction.' In this remote oceanic
island, for reasons which we cannot explain, there
lingers an isolated type which belongs to another age.</p>

<p>The following passage, which forms a fitting
introduction to an account of two other genera of
ancient ferns, is taken from a description of an
ascent of Mount Ophir in the Malay Peninsula by Dr
A. R. Wallace in his well-known book on the Malay
Archipelago:&mdash;'After passing a little tangled jungle
and swampy thickets, we emerged into a fine lofty
forest.... We ascended steadily up a moderate slope
for several miles, having a deep ravine on the
left. We then had a level plateau or shoulder to
cross, after which the ascent was steeper and the
forest denser till we came out upon the Padang-Batu,
or stone-field.... We found it to be a steep
slope of even rock, extending along the mountain
side farther than we could see. Parts of it were
quite bare, but where it was cracked and fissured
there grew a most luxuriant vegetation, among which
the pitcher plants were the most remarkable.... A few
coniferae of the genus Dacrydium here first appeared,
and in the thickets, just above the rocky surface,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">« 86 »</a></span>
we walked through groves of those splendid ferns,
<i>Dipteris Horsfieldii</i> and <i>Matonia pectinata</i>, which
bear large spreading fronds on slender stems, 6 or
8 feet high'(<a href="#Note_49">49</a>).</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">« 87 »</a></span></p>

<p>The two genera Matonia and Dipteris afford
exceptionally striking examples of survivals from
the past. Matonia is represented by two species,
<i>Matonia pectinata</i> (<a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>), which grows abundantly
on the upper slopes of Padang-Batu in dense thickets
on the rock faces where, as Mr Tansley states, its
associates are a species of Gleichenia, Dipteris,
and a little <i>Pteridium aquilinum</i> (Bracken Fern).
<i>Matonia pectinata</i> occurs also on Bornean mountains
at an altitude of over 3000 ft. and descends to the
coast on some of the Malay islands. The other
species of the genus, <i>Matonia sarmentosa</i>, has so
far been found in one locality only, Niak, Sarawak,
where it was discovered by Mr Charles Hose.
<i>Matonia pectinata</i> has a creeping stem covered with
a thick felt of brown hairs bearing tall fan-shaped
fronds divided into numerous comb-like branches
thickly set with narrow linear leaflets on which
circular clusters of spore-capsules are sparsely scattered.
In some respects Matonia is unlike other
ferns; the fronds constitute a striking feature, and
the anatomy of the stem is still more distinctive.
In the form, development, and arrangement of the
sporangia (spore-capsules)&mdash;organs which from the
constancy of their characters have long been recognised
as the most useful basis for classification&mdash;Matonia
exhibits distinctive features.</p>

<p>In order to emphasise the isolated position of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">« 88 »</a></span>
genus it has recently been placed in a separate
family, the Matonineae, of which it is the sole living
representative. The restricted geographical range of
Matonia, considered in connexion with the clearly
marked peculiarities in structure and form, leads us
to expect other evidence in support of the natural
inference that the genus is a survivor of a once
more vigorous and widely spread family. If Matonia
were a recently evolved type which has not spread
far from its original home, we should expect it to
conform more closely than it does to other ferns in
the Malay region. Even assuming for the sake of
argument that variation may occur <i>per saltum</i>, and
new forms may be produced differing in more than
the finer shades of small variation from their parents,
the peculiar features of Matonia are too pronounced
and its individual characteristics too obvious to
warrant the assumption of recent production. It is,
however, from the testimony of the rocks that we
obtain confirmation of the opinion that these Malayan
species are plants on the verge of extinction. In
shales of Jurassic age exposed on the Yorkshire coast
at Gristhorpe Bay and in iron-stained rocks of the
same age between Whitby and Scarborough, well
preserved leaves have been found agreeing in the
shape of the frond, as also in the form of the leaflets
and of the groups of sporangia which they bare, with
those of <i>Matonia pectinata</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">« 89 »</a></span></p>

<p>The exposure by a stroke of the hammer, on the
fractured surface of a rock picked up on the beach
at Hayburn Wyke (a few miles south of Whitby), of
a piece of fern frond which is unmistakably closely
allied to the species described by Wallace on Mount
Ophir, establishes a link between the Jurassic and
the present era and presents a fascinating problem in
geographical distribution. These fossil Matonias are
known to students of ancient plants as species of
the genus Matonidium, a name adopted by a German
botanist for specimens apparently identical with those
from the Yorkshire coast discovered in slightly younger
rocks (Wealden) in North Germany. The same type
has been found also in sediments of Wealden age on
the Sussex coast. Other leaf-impressions agreeing
closely with those of Matonidium have been obtained
from the Yorkshire Jurassic rocks and these are
assigned to another genus Laccopteris, an extinct
member of the family Matonineae. It is not merely
in the habit of the fronds and in the shape and
venation of the leaflets that these fossil ferns resemble
the existing species, but the more important features
exhibited by the spore-capsules supply additional evidence.
It has already been pointed out that the stems
of Matonia are characterised by a type of structure
unknown in an identical form in any other recent fern.</p>

<p>A few years ago Prof. Bommer discovered fragments
of leaves and stems in Wealden beds a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">« 90 »</a></span>
miles from Brussels sufficiently well preserved to
reveal the details of internal organisation. Some
of these fossils were found to possess structural
features identical with those of the Malayan species
of Matonia. A full account of the fossil representatives
of the Matonia family would be out of place in
a general essay on Links with the Past, but brief
reference may be made to some of the data which
throw light on the geological history of the family.
In strata classed by geologists as Rhaetic, a phase
of earth-history between the Triassic and Jurassic
eras (see <a href="#Page_42">p. 42</a>), species of Laccopteris and allied forms
have been described from several other countries;
from Jurassic and Wealden strata examples of both
Laccopteris and Matonia have been found in Germany,
Portugal, Belgium, Austria, and elsewhere. From
rocks of Cretaceous age, higher in the series than
the Wealden strata, well preserved impressions of
a Matonidium have been discovered in Moravia.
The Matonineae were widely distributed in Europe
during the Rhaetic and Jurassic periods, but, so far
as we know, the family did not survive in the northern
hemisphere beyond the limits of the Cretaceous
period. It is noteworthy that, in spite of the
preservation of the remains of Jurassic and Cretaceous
floras in many extra-European regions,
notably in India, South Africa, Australia, China, and
Tonkin, no specimens have been found which can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">« 91 »</a></span>
with confidence be assigned to the Matonineae. A
single fossil has, however, been described from Queensland
which may be a piece of a Laccopteris frond.</p>

<p>There is some evidence that ferns very similar to
Matonia existed in North America during the Mesozoic
period. It would be in the highest degree rash
to assume that the Matonineae played no part in
the Jurassic vegetation of India, South Africa, and
other southern lands, but there can be little doubt
that the family was especially characteristic of
European floras during a portion of the Mesozoic
era. It would seem that subsequent to the Wealden
period the ancestors of Matonia dwindled in numbers
and their geographical range became much more
restricted.</p>

<p>The records of Tertiary rocks have hitherto added
nothing to our knowledge of the distribution of the
family subsequent to the Cretaceous period. All
we can say is that the existing species of Matonia
are the last survivors of a family which in the
Jurassic period overspread a wide area in Europe
and probably extended to the other side of the
Atlantic. Exposed to unfavourable climatic conditions
and possibly affected by the revolution in
the plant world consequent on the appearance of
the Flowering Plants, the Matonineae gradually
retreated beyond the equator until the two surviving
species found a last retreat in the Malayan region.</p>

pectinata</i> on Mount Ophir and in the Malay region
generally, is one of seven species of a genus characterised
by a somewhat wider geographical range
than Matonia. <i>Dipteris conjugata</i> extends to the
Philippines, Samoa, Fiji, New Caledonia, New Guinea
and Central China; its fronds, like those of Matonia,
are borne on long slender stalks attached to a
creeping stem; they have a broad lamina divided by
a deep median sinus into two symmetrical halves and
each half is cut up into segments with a saw-like
edge. Several stout ribs spread through the lamina
from the apex of the long stalk like the open fingers
of a hand; from these ribs smaller veins are given
off at a wide angle, and these in turn give rise to a
reticulum of finer veins forming a skeletal system
like that in the leaves of an oak and many other
flowering plants.</p>

<p>Numerous groups of spore-capsules are borne on
the lower surface of the broad lobed frond. The
leaves of other species of Dipteris have the same
type of structure, but in some the segmentation of
the lamina is carried further and the leaf consists of
numerous long and narrow segments with one or two
main ribs. Dipteris is represented in the flora
of Assam, and it is interesting to find that a species
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">« 94 »</a></span>
recently discovered in Borneo is more closely connected
with the Assam type than with those of the
Malay region. Until a few years ago the genus
Dipteris was included in the large family Polypodiaceae
of which nearly all our British ferns are
members, but the discovery of certain distinguishing
features in the structure of the sporangia showed
that these Eastern and Southern species form a
fairly well-defined group worthy of family rank.</p>

<p>In the Rhaetic plant-beds of Northern and
Central Europe, of North America, Tonkin, and
elsewhere, numerous fossil leaves have been discovered
which in shape, venation, and in the
manner of occurrence of the sporangia bear a close
resemblance to species of Dipteris. Ferns of this
type were abundant in the Jurassic floras of the
northern hemisphere, and it is interesting to find
impressions of Dipteris-like leaves both in the
Jurassic rocks of the Yorkshire coast as well as in
slightly newer beds of the same geological period on
the north-east coast of Sutherland.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say with confidence how nearly
these Rhaetic and Jurassic ferns were related to the
existing species, as our knowledge of them is less
complete than in the case of the fossil representatives
of the Matonineae, but there can be no reasonable
doubt that in Dipteris as in Matonia we have a connecting
link between the present and a remote past.</p>

OF CALIFORNIA</p>

<p>Since their introduction into England about the
middle of the nineteenth century, the two Californian
species <i>Sequoia sempervirens</i> (the Redwood) and
<i>Sequoia gigantea</i> (the Mammoth tree) have become
familiar as cultivated trees. The name Sequoia,
said to be taken from Sequoiah, the inventor of the
Cherokee alphabet, was instituted in 1847, while the
name Wellingtonia, often used in horticulture though
discarded by botanists in favour of the older designation
Sequoia, was proposed in 1853. Both species
are now confined to a comparatively small area in
California: their restricted geographical range, considered
as an isolated fact, might be regarded as a
sign of recent origin. The records of the rocks,
however, afford ample proof that rarity in this as in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">« 96 »</a></span>
many other instances is the precursor of extinction.
The famous groves of Mariposa and Calaveras
represent the last resting-place of giant survivors
of a race which formerly held its own in Europe and
in other parts of the world.</p>

<p>The Redwood, <i>Sequoia sempervirens</i>, occupies a
narrow belt of country, rarely more than 20 or 30
miles from the coast, three hundred miles long from
Monterey in the south to the frontiers of Oregon;
it has a stronger hold on existence than Sequoia
gigantea. In Northern California it still forms pure
forests on the sides of ravines and on the banks of
streams. The tapering trunk, rising from a broad
base to over 300 ft., gives off short horizontal
branches thickly set with narrow spirally disposed
leaves <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch in length arranged in two ranks
like the similar leaves of the Yew. The lower
edge of each leaf is decurrent, that is it runs a
short distance down the axis of the branch instead of
terminating at the point of attachment. It is by
paying attention to such details as this as well as to
more important features, that we are able to connect
fragmentary fossil twigs with those of existing
species. The female 'flowers' have the form of
oblong cones from <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> to 1 inch long: each consists
of a central axis bearing crowded wedge-shaped,
woody appendages or cone-scales, which gradually
increase in breadth towards the exposed distal end
characterised by its four sloping sides and by a
median transverse groove. Several small seeds are
borne on the upper surface of the cone-scales. The
smaller and short-lived male flowers need not be
described.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">« 98 »</a></span></p>

<p>The other and better known species <i>Sequoia
gigantea</i> (<a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>) has an even more restricted range
and is confined to groves on the western slopes of
the Sierra Nevada between 3000 to 9000 ft. above
sea-level.</p>

<p>This tree is at once distinguished from the
Redwood by its ovate, sharply pointed and stiffer
leaves which retain their spiral disposition and
closely surround the axis of the twigs like obliquely-set
needles. The cones are of the same type as those
of <i>Sequoia sempervirens</i>, but are broader and may
attain a length of 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches (9·5 cm.) (<a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>).</p>

<p>Reference has already been made to Sequoia
as a striking illustration of longevity. It is also
selected as an equally impressive example of a type
verging on extinction, which played a prominent part
in the vegetation of both west and east during the
Cretaceous and Tertiary periods.</p>

<p>Scraps of branches with leaves hardly distinguishable
from those of the existing Californian trees
are frequently met with in Tertiary and Mesozoic
sediments, and with them occasionally occur cones
too imperfectly preserved to afford satisfactory
evidence of more than superficial agreement with
those of the recent species. The task of deciphering
the past history of plants, particularly of the Conifers,
is accompanied by many difficulties and insidious
temptations. It is clear from a critical examination
of many of the recorded instances of fossil Sequoias
that the generic name has been frequently used by
writers without adequate grounds. The fragmentary
specimens available to the botanical historian cannot
as a rule be subjected to microscopical investigation,
and even a partial acquaintance with the similarity
of the foliage of different types of living Conifers is
sufficient to convince the student of the need of self-control
in the identification of the fossils. It is,
however, easy to point out obvious pitfalls, though
difficult to maintain a judicial attitude in the
excitement of endeavouring to interpret documents
which are too incomplete to be identified with
certainty. If we put on one side all records of
supposed fossil Sequoias not based on satisfactory
data, there remains a wealth of material testifying to
the antiquity of the surviving species.</p>

<p>It is by no means improbable that Conifers
closely allied to the Redwoods and Mammoth trees
of California were represented in Jurassic floras;
but hitherto no proof has been obtained of the
occurrence of a Sequoia among the rich material
afforded by the Jurassic plant-beds of Yorkshire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">« 101 »</a></span>
and by beds of the same age in other countries.
A small cone has recently been described from
strata near Boulogne belonging to the latest phase
of the Jurassic period, which presents a strong
resemblance in shape and size and in the form of the
cone-scales to those of the recent species. This specimen,
though not conclusive, is the most satisfactory
indication of a Jurassic Sequoia so far discovered.
From Lower Jurassic rocks in Madagascar similar
cones have been recorded in association with foliage-shoots
like those of <i>Sequoia gigantea</i>, but here too
the evidence is not beyond suspicion. In plant-bearing
strata of Wealden age, such as are exposed
in the cliff near Hastings and in deposits of the same
age in North Germany, Portugal, and elsewhere,
twigs and cones have been found which may be
those of trees nearly allied to the genus Sequoia.</p>

</div>

<p>It is, however, in the sedimentary rocks of
Cretaceous age, rather higher in the series than
those in the Hastings cliffs, and in the succeeding
Tertiary rocks, that undoubted Sequoias are met
with in abundance. At Bovey Tracey in Devonshire
there is a basin-shaped depression in the granitic rocks
of Dartmoor filled with clay, gravel and sand&mdash;the
flood-deposits of a Tertiary lake containing waifs and
strays of the vegetation on the surrounding hills.
Among the commonest plants is one to which the
late Oswald Heer gave the name <i>Sequoia Couttsiae</i>,
and his reference of the specimens to the genus
Sequoia has been confirmed by the recent researches
of Air and Mrs Clement Reid(<a href="#Note_50">50</a>). This Tertiary
(Oligocene) species is represented by slender twigs
almost identical with those of <i>Sequoia gigantea</i> and
by well-preserved cone-scales and seeds (<a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>).
Moreover, it has been possible to examine microscopically
the structure of the carbonised outer skin
of the leaves and to demonstrate its agreement with
that of the superficial tissue in the leaves of the
Mammoth tree. With the Bovey Tracey Sequoia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">« 103 »</a></span>
are associated fragments of Magnolia, Vitis, and
<i>Taxodium distichum</i>, the swamp Cypress of North
America, together with other types which have long
ceased to exist in Western Europe. Other British
examples of Sequoia have been described from
Tertiary beds at Bournemouth, the Isle of Wight,
Sheppey, and Antrim, but the material from these
localities is inferior in preservation and cannot be
identified with the same degree of certainty as in the
case of the Devonshire specimens. The occurrence
of twigs and cones of several species of Sequoia in
both Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks in Austria,
Germany, Italy, France, and elsewhere, shows that
the ancestors of the Californian trees were common
in the European region.</p>

<p>The exploration of Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks
in Arctic Europe has revealed the former existence in
Greenland, Spitzbergen, and other more or less ice-covered
lands of plants which clearly denote a mild
climate. Cones and branches of Sequoias have been
found in abundance in Lower Tertiary beds on Disco
Island off the west coast of Greenland, and similar
evidence of the northern extension of the genus has
been obtained from Spitzbergen. Dr Nathorst of Stockholm
speaks of twigs of Sequoia in the Tertiary clays
of Ellesmere Land almost as perfect as herbarium
specimens. In Tertiary beds on the banks of the
Mackenzie River, in Alaska, Saghalien Island and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">« 104 »</a></span>
Vancouver Island, and in Upper Cretaceous rocks in
the Queen Charlotte Islands, remains of Sequoia have
been discovered. One of the most remarkable instances
of the preservation of trees of a bygone age
is supplied by the volcanic deposits of Lower Tertiary
age exposed on the slopes of Amethyst mountain
in the Yellowstone Park district. At different levels
in the volcanic and sedimentary material, which is
piled up to a height of over 2000 ft. above the valley,
as many as fifteen forests are represented by erect
and prostrate limbs of petrified trees (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>). The
microscopical examination of some of these trees
has shown that they bear a striking resemblance to
<i>Sequoia sempervirens</i>. In a photograph of these
petrified forests by the U.S. Geological Survey (36, 2)
one sees living Conifers side by side with the lichen-covered
and weathered trunks of the fossil species
(<i>Sequoia magnifica</i>), living and extinct being at a
distance hardly distinguishable. (Frontispiece.)</p>

<p>In concluding this brief survey of the fossil records
of Sequoia, reference may be made to the discovery
of petrified wood in Cretaceous rocks in South Nevada,
possessing the anatomical features of <i>Sequoia gigantea</i>,
which shows that close to the present home of the big
trees their ancestors flourished during a period of the
earth's history too remote to be measured by human
reckoning.</p>

<p>The distribution of the Tertiary and Cretaceous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">« 105 »</a></span>
Sequoias would appear to have been mainly in the
northern hemisphere, extending well within the Arctic
circle. It is, however, by no means improbable that
the ancestors of Sequoia flourished far south of the
equator. Reference has been made to Jurassic fossils
from Madagascar which have been compared with the
existing species, and from Lower Tertiary beds in
New Zealand the late Baron Ettingshausen described
some cones and twigs as <i>Sequoia novae zeelandicae</i>
which bear a close resemblance to the existing type.
The available evidence would seem to point to a
northern origin of the genus, though allowance must
be made for erroneous conclusions based on negative
evidence. Further research may well extend the past
distribution of Sequoia in southern lands, but the
data to hand point to the conclusion that the Californian
trees represent the survivors of a type which
flourished in the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods
over a wide area in North America and in what we
now call the Continent of Europe.</p>

<p>As an additional illustration of existing cone-bearing
trees which form links with the past we may
briefly consider the genera Araucaria and Agathis,
the two members of the family Araucarieae. It is
generally agreed that the branches of the genealogical
tree of this family extended farther back into the
past than in the case of the majority of Conifers. By
some authors the surviving representatives of the
Araucarian stock are considered to have a strong
claim to be regarded as the most primitive as well as
the oldest of cone-bearing trees, though this opinion,
like many others, is not held by botanists as a whole.
This is not the place to discuss matters of controversy,
and I shall confine myself to a general consideration
of Araucaria and Agathis from the point of view of
their present distribution and the part they played in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">« 107 »</a></span>
the vegetation of the Mesozoic and Tertiary epochs.
In 1741 a plant from Amboyna, one of the Moluccas, was
described under the name <i>Dammara alba</i>. For this
tree, known as the Amboyna Fine, the English botanist
Salisbury instituted the generic name Agathis, from a
Greek word (&#945;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#953;&#962;) meaning a ball of string and probably
suggested by the form of the cones, which is the
designation usually adopted in botanical literature
instead of the pre-Linnean term Dammara. The best
known species of the genus is the Kauri Pine, probably
the finest forest tree in New Zealand where it still
flourishes from the North Cape to latitude 38&deg; S.,
though the occurrence of sub-fossil trunks and pieces
of buried resin shows that the Kauri forests are gradually
dwindling. The stems of this species, <i>Agathis
australis</i>, rise like massive grey columns to a height
of 160 ft., terminating in a succession of spreading
branches given off in tiers from the main trunk. The
thick narrow lanceolate leaves, with several parallel
veins, reach a length of 2 to 3 inches. The female
shoots have the form of small and almost spherical
cones consisting of a central axis bearing overlapping
spiral series of broadly triangular scales (<a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a>).
Each scale carries a single seed with a large wing
attached to one side which facilitates disposal by
wind. Other species of Agathis occur in the Malay
Archipelago, the Philippines, in Queensland, in the
New Hebrides, New Caledonia, the Fiji Islands, and
elsewhere. With the exception of the Australian
Kauri (<i>Agathis robusta</i>), with leaves larger and
broader than those of the New Zealand Kauri, the
genus is essentially an island type. With the exception
of some species of the southern hemisphere
genus Podocarpus, there are no Conifers with foliage
like that of Agathis. It is, however, the broad and thin
single-seeded scales and the spherical cones, in some
species six inches in length, which furnish the most
trustworthy means of identifying the genus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">« 109 »</a></span></p>

<p>The allied genus Araucaria, with the exception
of two South American species, the familiar Monkey
Puzzle, <i>Araucaria imbricata</i>, and a Brazilian tree,
<i>Araucaria brasiliana</i>, is confined within the geographical
area occupied by Agathis. The name Araucaria
was first used by de Jussieu in 1789 for a plant
previously referred to the genus Pinus and described
as one of the most beautiful trees of Chili. This
species, <i>A. imbricata</i>, introduced into England in
1796, grows on the southern slopes of the Andes and,
as in the case of the Kauri forests of New Zealand,
buried stems point to a wider extension of the forests
in earlier days. The sharp and thick leaves of the
Monkey Puzzle distinguish it from all other Conifers;
its large almost spherical seed-bearing cones, more
than half a foot in length, which may occasionally be
seen on well-grown British trees, are unlike those of
other genera. Each of the deep and narrow scales
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">« 110 »</a></span>
bears a single seed embedded in the substance of the
scale and terminates distally in a narrow upturned
process. Some species of Araucaria, differing considerably
in the form of the leaves and in the shape
and structure of the seed-scales from the Chilian
species, are conveniently placed in a distinct sub-division
of the genus Araucaria. Of this type the
Norfolk Island Pine, <i>Araucaria excelsa</i>, is the best-known
example (<a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>). It was introduced to Kew
by Sir Joseph Banks in 1793, soon after its discovery
by Captain Cook, who describes the stems of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">« 111 »</a></span>
Norfolk Island trees as resembling basaltic columns,
and relates how on approaching the island everyone
was satisfied that the columnar objects were trees,
'except our Philosophers, who still maintained they
were basaltes.' The leaves are short, about half an
inch long, laterally compressed and slightly spreading
and sickle-shaped&mdash;sometimes shorter and broader
and overlapping&mdash;arranged in crowded spirals. The
scales of the broadly oval cones are single-seeded, but
differ from those of <i>Araucaria imbricata</i> in having the
seed exposed on the surface and in the greater breadth
and thinner borders of the scales. In both Araucaria
and Agathis the nature of the seed-scales constitutes
a distinguishing feature. The leaves of <i>Araucaria
imbricata</i> differ in form from those of other Conifers.
The foliage shoots of <i>Araucaria excelsa</i> and other
species, <i>e.g.</i> the very closely allied <i>A. Cookii</i> of the
New Hebrides and New Caledonia, though not unlike
the branches of a Japanese Conifer (<i>Cryptomeria
japonica</i>), often cultivated in England, afford fairly
trustworthy characters for identification purposes.</p>

<p>The minute structure of the wood of both Araucaria
and Agathis constitutes an important distinguishing
feature and enables us to recognise on microscopical
examination even a fragment of wood of either of
these genera. The small elongated cells or water-conducting
elements of the wood of the Araucarieae
are characterised by one or two, and occasionally as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">« 112 »</a></span>
many as three or four, contiguous rows of pits on their
radial walls, and these appear in surface view as
flattened circles or polygonal areas.</p>

<p>These details have been mentioned in order to show
that Araucaria and Agathis are sufficiently distinct
in many respects from other Conifers to render their
identification in a fossil state comparatively easy, at
least much easier than the recognition of the majority
of the members of the Coniferae. It would be going
too far to state definitely that Araucarieae, as defined
by reference to existing species, existed during the
Palaeozoic period; on the other hand it would seem
in a high degree probable that the vegetation of the
Coal age and of the succeeding Permian period included
trees in which certain Araucarian characters
were clearly foreshadowed. The name Araucarioxylon
was formerly applied to petrified wood, obtained from
Palaeozoic as well as from later formations, which
agrees anatomically with that of Araucaria and Agathis.
It has been shown in recent years that much of the
Palaeozoic wood of this type of structure belongs
to the extinct genus Cordaites, a tree which played
a prominent part in the earlier floras. Cordaites
affords a good example of a generalised type: in
its wood-structure it resembles very closely the
existing Araucarieae; its long strap-like leaves are
not unlike those of some species of Agathis; its
male flowers have often been compared with those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">« 113 »</a></span>
of the Maiden Hair tree, <i>Ginkgo biloba</i>, and certain
anatomical features form connecting links between
this Palaeozoic genus and the Cycads.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that in another Palaeozoic genus,
Walchia, the leaf-bearing branches are identical in appearance
with those of the Norfolk Island Pine (<a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>)
and some other species of Araucaria. Unfortunately
our knowledge of the reproductive organs of Walchia
is insufficient to warrant any definite statement as to
the degree of consanguinity between this Permian and
Upper Carboniferous plant and the Araucarieae; it
is probable that in Walchia we have a type not far
removed from the line of evolution which led to
Araucaria. Petrified wood, identified as that of
Walchia, and exhibiting the Araucarian type of structure,
has been recorded from Permian rocks of the
Vosges. Other instances might be quoted in support
of the view that the Palaeozoic floras included a few
plants with which the surviving Araucarieae may
fairly claim relationship. Professor Zeiller of Paris
has recently described some fossil shoots from Palaeozoic
rocks in India under the name <i>Araucarites
Oldhami</i> on the ground of the similarity of the leaves
to those of <i>Araucaria imbricata</i>. Similarly, from
Triassic rocks several fossils have been described as
closely allied to Araucaria, in some cases because of
anatomical resemblances and in others on the less
satisfactory evidence furnished by a similarity in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">« 114 »</a></span>
foliage shoots. Professor Jeffrey of Harvard has recently
given an account of a new type of stem
(Woodworthia) from the petrified Triassic forest of
Arizona possessing some Araucarian characters,
though differing from existing species of Araucaria
in certain structural features, a combination of
characters regarded by this Author as an indication
of relationship with the family of Conifers, which
includes the Pines, Firs, Larches and other well-known
northern genera.</p>

<p>It is, however, from the records of Jurassic rocks
that we obtain the most satisfactory information as to
the great antiquity and the very wide geographical
range of the ancestors of the recent genus. The plant-beds
of the Yorkshire coast afford clear evidence of
the occurrence of Araucarian trees in the woodlands
of the Jurassic period. Petrified wood has been found
at Whitby, associated with jet, showing the minute
structural characteristics of the surviving species of
Araucarieae, and it is not improbable that some at
least of the Whitby jet has been formed from the wood
of Araucarian plants. The carbonised remains of
leafy shoots preserved in the Jurassic shales near
Scarborough and on other parts of the Yorkshire
coast include twigs hardly distinguishable from those
of <i>Araucaria excelsa</i>, though the resemblance of
external form alone, especially in the case of foliage
shoots, does not amount to proof of generic identity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">« 115 »</a></span>
We have, however, the much more trustworthy evidence
of cones and seed-bearing scales in which the
characteristic features of living species are clearly
shown. Seed-bearing scales almost identical with those
of <i>Araucaria excelsa</i> and other recent species have
long been known from the Jurassic rocks of Yorkshire.</p>

<p>From other parts of England where samples of
Jurassic floras are preserved, as at Stonesfield in
Oxfordshire, in Northamptonshire and elsewhere,
equally striking examples of undoubted Araucarias
have been found.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a> represents part of a large cone described
in 1866 by Mr Carruthers from Jurassic rocks at
Bruton in Somersetshire: this specimen, now in the
British Museum, consists of one side of a spherical
cone about 5 inches long and 5 inches broad; in size,
as in the form of the seed-scales, it shows a striking
likeness to the cones of the Australian species
<i>Araucaria Bidwillii</i>, the Bunya Bunya of Queensland.
Other equally convincing examples of Jurassic
Araucarian cones and seeds may be seen in the
museums of York and Northampton. On the north-east
coast of Sutherland there is a narrow strip of
Jurassic beds forming a low platform between the
granitic and Old Red Sandstone hills and the sea.
From these rocks Hugh Miller described several
fossil plants in his <i>Testimony of the Rocks</i>, and an
examination of a large collection obtained from this
district by the late Dr Marcus Gunn shows that
Miller was justified in speaking of Araucaria as a
member of this northern flora.</p>

<p>There is abundant evidence pointing to the existence
in Britain during the Jurassic period, and in
the early days of the Cretaceous epoch, of Araucarian
trees which differed but slightly from the modern
species confined to the southern hemisphere. In
several localities in France, Germany, and other parts
of the continent, Araucarian fossils have been recognised
in Jurassic rocks. It is almost certain that
some foliage shoots and imperfectly preserved cones
described by Dr Nathorst from Upper Jurassic rocks
in Spitzbergen were borne by a species of Araucaria.
Cone-scales very similar to those from Yorkshire have
been discovered in Wealden beds in Cape Colony, and
Araucarian wood of Jurassic and Cretaceous age has
been found in Madagascar. From Jurassic strata in
India and Victoria (Australia), as well as from Upper
Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous rocks in Virginia and
elsewhere in the eastern United States, well preserved
Araucarian fossils are recorded. In a collection of
Jurassic plants, obtained a few years ago by the
members of a Swedish Antarctic Expedition in
Graham's Land, Dr Nathorst has recognised some
cone-scales of Araucaria, which demonstrate a former
extension of the family beyond the southern limits of
South America.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">« 118 »</a></span></p>
<p>It is interesting to find that when we ascend higher
in the geological series and pass beyond the Wealden
strata to the Middle and Upper sub-divisions of the
Cretaceous period, evidence of the wide geographical
distribution of the Araucarieae is still abundant.
Araucarian wood has been obtained in rocks classed
as Upper Cretaceous in Egypt, in East Africa, in
Dakota, and elsewhere. In the sedimentary rocks of
the Tertiary period undoubted examples of Araucaria
are less common, though there can be no doubt that
the genus was much more widely spread then than
it is at the present day. The well-known Tertiary
plant-beds of Bournemouth have afforded specimens
of foliage shoots which have been described as a
species of Araucaria, though in the absence of well-preserved
cones or petrified wood we must admit
that the data are inconclusive. It is, however,
legitimate to regard the striking similarity of the
Bournemouth twigs to those of <i>Araucaria excelsa</i>
and <i>A. Cookii</i> as constituting a fairly strong case in
favour of the persistence of Araucaria in Western
Europe up to the earlier stage of the Tertiary period.
Araucarian wood of Tertiary age is recorded from
India, while branches with broad leaves like those
of <i>Araucaria imbricata</i> have been found in Seymour
Island and the Magellan Straits, and specimens
of Tertiary wood are described from Patagonia.
At the other end of the world. Tertiary rocks on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">« 119 »</a></span>
west coast of Greenland have yielded fragments which
may be referred with some hesitation to the genus
Araucaria.</p>

<p>A few words must be added in regard to the recent
discovery by Professor Jeffrey and Dr Hollick of some
very interesting Cretaceous specimens in New Jersey
of well-preserved cone-scales and foliage shoots of
extinct plants closely related to the existing species
of Agathis(<a href="#Note_51">51</a>). The American fossils are particularly
valuable because their preservation admits of microscopical
examination of the tissues. In Cretaceous
rocks of Staten Island and in other localities on the
eastern border of the northern United States, kite-shaped
seed-bearing scales almost identical in form
with those of recent species of Agathis are fairly
common fossils. Similar specimens have long been
known from Tertiary rocks in western Greenland.
In the case of some of the American examples each
scale bore three seeds instead of a single seed in
living species: on account of this difference Prof.
Jeffrey and Dr Hollick have adopted a distinct
generic name, <i>Protodammara</i>.</p>

<p>The foregoing sketch is necessarily far from complete,
but it may serve as an illustration of the light
which is thrown on the past history of recent plants
by the investigation of the relics of ancient floras.
The family Araucarieae now represented by a small
number of species which, with the exception of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">« 120 »</a></span>
Andian and Brazilian Araucarias, are restricted to a
small region in the southern hemisphere, was one of
the most widely spread sections of the seed-bearing
plants during the Mesozoic era. Ancestors of Araucaria
must have been common trees in the European
vegetation in Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous periods,
and even as late as the Tertiary period there is evidence
that representatives of the family still lingered in
the north. One conclusion which seems almost unavoidable
is that the species of Araucaria and Agathis
that survive, in some cases only in one or two small
islands in the South Pacific, have in the course of
successive ages wandered from the other end of the
world. Their migrations can be partially traced by
the fragments embedded in Jurassic and later sediments,
but we can only speculate as to the causes
which have contributed to the changes in the fortunes
of the family; how much influence may have been
exerted by changes in physical conditions in the
environment, and to what extent the production of
more successful types may have been the dominant
cause of the decline, it is impossible to say. One
thing at least is certain, that few existing plants are
better entitled to veneration as survivals from the
past than are the living species of Araucaria.</p>

<p>The Maiden Hair tree of China and Japan, which
was introduced into Europe early in the eighteenth
century, has now become fairly well known. Though
hardy in England, it requires warmer summers for
full development and regular flowering. To botanists
this Eastern tree is of peculiar interest, partly
because of the isolated position it occupies in the
plant-kingdom and partly by reason of its great
antiquity. There is probably no other existing tree
which has so strong a claim to be styled a 'living
fossil,' to use a term applied by Darwin to survivals
from the past. In 1712 the traveller Kaempfer
proposed for this plant the generic name Ginkgo,
and Linnaeus adopted this designation, adding the
specific name <i>biloba</i> to denote the bisection of
the wedge-shaped lamina of the leaf into two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">« 122 »</a></span>
divergent segments. In 1777 the English botanist
Sir J. E. Smith expressed his disapproval of what
he called the uncouth name Ginkgo by substituting
for <i>Ginkgo biloba</i> the title Salisburia adiantifolia,
but as it is customary to retain names adopted or
proposed by Linnaeus, the founder of the binominal
system of nomenclature, the correct botanical designation
of the maiden hair tree is <i>Ginkgo biloba</i>.
Mere personal preference such as that of Sir J. E.
Smith for Salisburia is not an adequate reason for
rejecting an older name.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">« 123 »</a></span></p>

<p>In its pyramidal habit Ginkgo agrees generally
with the larch and other Conifers. Like the larch
and cedar it possesses two kinds of foliage shoots,
the more rapidly growing long shoots with scattered
leaves and the much shorter dwarf-shoots which
elongate slightly each year and bear several leaves
crowded round their apex. The leaves (<a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>),
which are shed each year, are similar in the cuneate
form of the lamina and in the fan-like distribution
of the forked veins, to the large leaflets of some
species of maiden hair ferns: the thin lamina carried
by a slender leaf-stalk is usually about 3 inches
across, though in exceptional cases it may reach a
breadth of 8 inches. The lamina is usually divided
by a deep <b>V</b>-shaped sinus into two equal halves;
it may be entire with an irregularly crenulate margin,
or, on seedlings and vigorous long shoots, the lamina
may be cut into several wedge-shaped segments.</p>

<p>The male and female flowers are borne on separate
trees; the male consists of a central axis giving off
slender branches, each of which ends in a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">« 124 »</a></span>
terminal knot and two elliptical capsules in which
the pollen is produced. The female flowers have
a stouter axis which normally produces two seeds
at the apex. The seed is encased in a green fleshy
substance and, as in the fruit of a cherry or plum,
the kernel is protected by a hard woody shell. In
the form of the leaves and in the structure of the
flowers Ginkgo presents features which clearly distinguish
it from the Conifers, the class in which,
until recently, it was included. In 1896 the Japanese
botanist Hirase made the important discovery that
the male reproductive cells of Ginkgo are large
motile bodies provided with a spirally coiled band
of minute cilia&mdash;delicate hairs which by their
rapid lashing-movement propel the cell through
water. In all Flowering Plants and in Conifers the
male reproductive cells have no independent means
of locomotion; they are carried to the female cell
by the formation of a slender tube&mdash;the pollen-tube&mdash;produced
by the pollen-grain. In the Ferns, Lycopods
and Horsetails&mdash;in fact in all members of
the Pteridophyta&mdash;as also in the Mosses and Liverworts
as well as in many of the still lower plants, the
male cells swim to the egg by the lashing of cilia
like those on the male cells of Ginkgo. This difference
in regard to the nature of the male cells was considered
to be a fundamental distinction between the
higher seed-bearing plants and all other groups of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">« 125 »</a></span>
the vegetable kingdom. It was, therefore, with no
ordinary interest that Hirase's discovery was received,
as it broke down a distinction between the two great
divisions of the plant-world which had been generally
accepted as fundamental; though it is only fair to
say that the German botanist Hofmeister, a man of
exceptional originality and power of grasping the
essential, foresaw the possibility that this arbitrary
barrier would eventually be removed. The Ferns
and other plants in which the male cells are motile,
represent earlier stages in the progress of plant
development, when the presence of water was essential
for the act of fertilisation, a relic of earlier days
when the whole plant-body was fitted for a life in
water. As higher types were produced, the plant-machinery
became less dependent on an aqueous
habitat, and the loss of organs of locomotion in the
male cells is an instance of the kind of change
accompanying the gradual adaptation to life on
land. The idea of the gradual emancipation of plants
from a watery environment is expressed in a somewhat
extreme form by the author of a book entitled
<i>The Lessons of Evolution</i>(<a href="#Note_52">52</a>), who states that the
ocean is the mother of plant-life and that plants
formed the army which conquered the land. In
Ginkgo we have a type which, though similar in
most respects to the Conifers, possesses in its motile
reproductive cells a persistent inheritance from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">« 126 »</a></span>
past. The recognition of this special feature afforded
a sound reason, especially when other peculiarities are
considered, for removing Ginkgo from the Conifers
and instituting a new class-name, Ginkgoales.</p>

<p>Ginkgo is a generalised type, linked by different
characters both with living members of the two classes
of naked-seeded plants and with certain existing
Palaeozoic genera. It is a survivor of a race which
has narrowly escaped extinction; the last of a long
line that has outlived its family and offers by its persistence
an impressive instance of the past in the
present. Though Mrs Bishop in her <i>Untrodden
Paths in Japan</i> speaks of forests of Maiden Hair
trees apparently in a wild state, it is generally
believed that they were cultivated specimens.
Mr Henry who has an exceptionally wide knowledge
of Chinese vegetation tells us that 'all scientific
travellers in Japan and the leading Japanese botanists
and foresters deny its being indigenous in any part of
Japan; and botanical collectors have not observed it
truly wild in China.' Moreover, Mr E. H. Wilson,
after traversing the whole of the district where
Ginkgo was supposed to occur in a wild state, says
that he found only cultivated trees. There is no reason
to doubt that China is the last stronghold of this
ancient type which in an earlier period of the earth's
history overspread the world.</p>

<p>A brief summary of the past history of Ginkgo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">« 127 »</a></span>
and of the Ginkgoales supplies overwhelming testimony
to the tenacity of life with which the Maiden
Hair tree has persisted through the ages.</p>

<p>It was pointed out in the account of the past
history of Araucaria that the records obtained from
Palaeozoic rocks, while affording evidence of the
existence of Carboniferous and Permian genera undoubtedly
allied to the living species, do not enable
us to speak with certainty as to the precise degree of
affinity. Similarly, Palaeozoic leaves have been described
as representatives of the class of which Ginkgo
is the sole survivor, but the evidence on which this
relationship is assumed is by no means conclusive.</p>

<p>The generic name Psygmophyllum has been applied
to some impressions of Ginkgo-like leaves discovered
in the Upper Devonian rocks of Bear Island, a small
remnant of land in the Arctic circle, which has furnished
valuable information as to the composition of
one of the oldest floras of which satisfactory remains
have been found. Other examples of these lobed,
wedge-shaped leaves are recorded from Carboniferous
rocks in Germany, France, and elsewhere; from
Permian strata in the east of Russia and from Palaeozoic
beds in Cape Colony and Kashmir. A relationship
between Psygmophyllum and Ginkgo is, however, by
no means established and rests solely on a resemblance
in the form of the leaves. The close correspondence in
form and venation between some leaves from Permian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">« 128 »</a></span>
rocks in the Ural mountains and from Lower Permian
beds in France, and those of the recent species, is
considered by some authors sufficiently striking to
justify the reference of these fossils to the genus
Ginkgo. Similar leaves of Permian age, which may
also be related to the existing species, have been
described under the name Ginkgophyllum. Other
specimens of Palaeozoic age from North America
and elsewhere have been assigned to the Ginkgoales;
but in none of these cases, despite the resemblance
in leaf-form, is there sufficiently convincing evidence
of close relationship to warrant a definite assertion
that the plants in question were members of the
group of which Ginkgo alone remains.</p>

<p>It is, however, an undoubted fact that the Maiden
Hair tree is connected by a long line of ancestors
with the earliest phase of the Mesozoic era. From
many parts of the world large collections of fossil
plants have been obtained from strata referred to
the Rhaetic period, or to the upper division of the
Triassic system. A comparison of floras from these
geological horizons in different parts of the world
points to a vegetation extending from Australia,
Cape Colony, and South America, to Tonkin, the south
of Sweden and North America, which was characterised
by a greater uniformity than is shown by widely
separated floras at the present day. One of the commonest
genera in Rhaetic floras is that known as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">« 129 »</a></span>
Baiera; this name is applied to wedge-shaped leaves
with a slender stalk similar in shape and venation to
those of Ginkgo, but differing in the greater number
and smaller breadth of the segments. Between the
deeply dissected leaf of a typical Baiera with its
narrow linear lobes and the entire or broadly lobed
leaf of a Ginkgo there are many connecting links, and
to some specimens either name might be applied with
equal fitness. Examples of Baiera leaves, in some
cases associated with fragments of reproductive organs,
are recorded from Rhaetic rocks of France, the south
of Sweden, Tonkin, Chili, the Argentine, North America,
South Africa, and from other regions. There is abundant
evidence pointing to the almost world-wide
distribution of the Ginkgoales, as represented more
especially by Baiera, in the older Mesozoic floras. In
the later Jurassic rocks of Yorkshire true Ginkgo
leaves as well as those of the Baiera type are fairly
common; with the leaves have been found pieces
of male and female flowers. Ginkgo and Baiera
have been described from Jurassic rocks of Germany,
France, Russia, Bornholm, and elsewhere in Europe;
they occur abundantly in Middle Jurassic rocks in
northern Siberia, and are represented in the Jurassic
floras of Franz Josef Land, the East Coast of
Greenland, and Spitzbergen (<a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>). The abundance
of Ginkgo and Baiera leaves associated with
male flowers and seeds discovered in Jurassic rocks,
approximately of the same geological age as those on
the Yorkshire coast, in East Siberia and in the Amur
district, has led to the suggestion that this region
may have been a centre where the Ginkgoales reached
their maximum development in the Mesozoic period.</p>

<p>It should be added that other genera of Jurassic
and Rhaetic fossils in addition to Ginkgo and Baiera
have been referred to the Ginkgoales, though evidence
of such affinity is not convincing. There is, however,
good reason to believe that this widespread group
was represented by several genera in the older Mesozoic
floras.</p>

<p>The occurrence of the Ginkgoales in Jurassic rocks
in King Charles Land and in the New Siberian Islands
(lat. 78&deg; and 75&deg; N.), in Central China, Japan,
Turkestan, California, Oregon, South Africa, Australia,
and Graham's Land demonstrates the cosmopolitan
nature of the group. During the later part of the
Jurassic period and in the Wealden floras both Baiera
and Ginkgo were abundant; leaves are recorded from
Jurassic strata in the north-east of Scotland, from
Lower Cretaceous or Wealden rocks in North Germany,
Portugal, Vancouver Island, Wyoming, and Greenland.</p>

<p>During the Tertiary period, or probably in the
earlier days of that era. Ginkgo flourished in North
America, in Alaska and in the Mackenzie River district,
Greenland, Saghalien Island, and in several European
regions. In <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III</a> reference was made to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">« 132 »</a></span>
volcanic activity which characterised the north-west
European area in the early Tertiary period and resulted
in the formation of the thick sheets of basalt on the
north-east coast of Ireland and in the Inner Hebrides.
There were occasional pauses in the volcanic activity,
during which vegetation established itself on the
weathered surface of the lava, and left traces of its
existence in the leaves and twigs preserved in the
sedimentary material enclosed between successive
lava-floras. At Ardtun Head in the Isle of Mull
beautifully preserved leaves of Ginkgo, 2-4 inches
in breadth, with the median sinus and the venation
characteristic of the leaves of the existing plant, have
been discovered in a bed of clay which marks the site
of a lake in a depression on the lava-plateau. The
resemblance of these Tertiary leaves from Mull to
those of the surviving Maiden Hair tree is so close as
to suggest specific identity. Mr Starkie Gardner and
Baron Ettingshausen have described some seeds from
the London clay (Lower Tertiary) in the Isle of Sheppey
as those of Ginkgo, but this identification rests on
data too insufficient to be accepted without hesitation.</p>

<p>The recent cultivation of <i>Ginkgo biloba</i> in Britain
may therefore be spoken of as the re-introduction of
a plant which in the earlier part or in the middle of
the Tertiary period flourished in the west of Scotland,
and was abundant in England in the earlier Jurassic
period. It is impossible to say with any confidence
where the Ginkgoales first made their appearance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">« 133 »</a></span>,
whether in the far north or in the south, nor are we
able to explain the gradual decline of so venerable
and vigorous a race.</p>

<p>As we search among the fragmentary herbaria
scattered through the sedimentary rocks in that comparatively
small portion of the earth's crust which is
accessible to investigation, we discover evidence of
a shifting of the balance of power among different
classes of plants in the course of our survey of successive
floras. Plants now insignificant and few in
number are found to be descendants of a long line of
ancestors stretching back to a remote antiquity when
they formed the dominant class. Others which flourished
in a former period no longer survive, either
themselves or in direct descendants. 'The extinction
of species has been involved in the most gratuitous
mystery.' We can only speculate vaguely as to the
cause of success or failure. Certain types were better
armed for the struggle for life, and produced descendants
able to hold their own and to perpetuate
the race through the ages in an unbroken line.
Others had a shorter life and fell out of the ranks of
the advancing and ever changing army. To quote
Darwin's words:'We need not marvel at extinction;
if we must marvel, let it be at our own presumption
in imagining for a moment that we understand the
many complex contingencies on which the existence
of each species depends.'</p>

<p>"For those who have neither the time nor the preliminary
training to study great subjects on a grand scale these excellent
handbooks seem specially designed. They have been written by
scholars of eminence, and give in small compass an admirable
epitome of the subjects with which they deal These little
volumes represent the essence that the specialism of to-day can
give to the people in popular form on the subjects dealt with."</p>

<p>"The Cambridge Manuals of Science and Literature have
already conquered a wide audience amongst cultured people. They
are short studies of great subjects, and are published by the University
Press at one shilling The Cambridge Press is casting
its literary net widely."</p>

<p class="tdr">
<i>Standard</i><br />
</p>


<p>"On scientific subjects we must have the latest word from the
expert, and these Cambridge Manuals are easily the best primers
on the market. They are for the mature reader who wishes to find
in as short a compass as possible a semi-popular and broad treatment
of recent discoveries and modern tendencies. An excellent
prospectus has been issued, in which is given a wonderful list of
subjects and authors Every conceivable aspect of modern
knowledge is represented in the scope of the series, which is truly
one of the most important publishing enterprises of recent years."</p>

<p>"No such masterpieces of concentrated excellence as these
Cambridge Manuals have been published since the Literature and

men of that day made complete expositions in miniature of their
respective subjects The increase of specialisation which is
